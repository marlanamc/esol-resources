## Audit fixes (2026-01-30)

**Grammar alignment**
- **2/10** Workplace Policies: Phrasal Verbs — Part C changed from Present Perfect & PPC to **Present Perfect only** (PPC not taught until 2/24).
- **2/12** Worksheet converted from "Workplace: Present Perfect & PPC" to **Workplace: Past Perfect** (file renamed to `workplace-past-perfect-2026-02-12-warmup.html`) to match Week 6 grammar.

**Vocabulary level (NRS 3–4)**
- **Workplace Small Talk (2/3):** Part A upgraded from basic (weekend, lunch, chat, plans) to NRS 3–4: **time off**, **connection**, **break**, **colleague**, **team**, **schedule**. Part B, Reading, and Writing updated to use time off / colleagues / schedule. Phrasal-verb small talk (3/31) and summer-next-steps examples updated to use "time off" and "break" where appropriate.

**Vocabulary dedupe (health)**
- Part A vocabulary was de-duplicated across health worksheets so no word repeats. Changes: *healthcare-advice-warmup* → diagnosis, referral, dosage, contagious, follow-up, checkup (was appointment, prescription, fever); *symptoms-duration* → sign, temperature, recovery (was symptom, fever, rest); *home-remedies* → ailment (was symptom); *symptoms-treatment* → extend, recover, advance (was continue, improve, progress); *health-habits (04-16)* → pattern (was routine); *wellness-basics* → adapt, custom (was adjust, routine); *wellness-review* → recap, cycle, outcome, keep, sustain (was habit, routine, progress, continue, maintain); *wellness-reflection-2026-06-04* → milestone, growth, obstacle, achievement, strengthen, confident (distinct from 05-28 reflection list).

**Date/title fixes (header and filename match)**
- **final-reflections-2026-06-16** — Header date set to June 16, 2026 (was June 9).
- **final-presentation-2026-06-16** — Title/h1 set to "Final Presentation Rehearsal" (was "Final Reflections of the School Year").
- **wellness-reflection-2026-06-04** — Header date set to June 4, 2026 (was May 28).
- **nutrition-2026-05-14** — Header date set to May 14, 2026 (was May 19).
- **stress-2026-05-21** — Title/h1 set to "Stress Solutions", header date set to May 21, 2026 (was Daily Self-Care / May 14).
- **home-remedies-2026-05-19** — Title/h1 set to "Home Remedies", header date set to May 19, 2026 (was Daily Care Routines / May 12).

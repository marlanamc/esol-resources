# Grammar Guides Audit & Improvement Plan

## Combine

### 1. Consolidated Gerunds & Infinitives Patterns Guide
- **Scope:** Merge “Infinitives vs Gerunds (6 Patterns)”, “Verbs + Gerunds”, and “Gerunds After Prepositions” into one living reference so students stop bouncing between overlapping mini-guides.
- **Key sections:** Pattern matrix (Subject/Verb/Preposition + -ing vs Adjective/Noun/Verb + to), verbs that always take gerunds, prepositions that lock in gerunds, context-specific exercises, and a reflection checklist for choosing the right form in speaking.
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** Housing (I enjoy touring apartments, I plan to move next month), Jobs (I remember to submit a resume, I love negotiating schedules), Health (I avoid skipping meds, I want to start walking daily), Community (I’m excited about the East Boston health fair). Use dialogues that mix housing + job tasks so students see how gerunds and infinitives signal intention vs routine.
- **Difficulty level:** Core sections with fill-in and matching (high beginner), paired with “Why did I choose this form?” prompts and quick writing challenges for upper-intermediate learners.
- **Addresses struggles:** Clarifies sentence structure when selecting verb forms, reinforces gerund + preposition patterns, and keeps guidance accessible for the wide Level 3 band.

-### 2. Conditionals Continuum Guide
- **Scope:** Combine zero/first/future conditionals and pair the second conditional with third so students trace the continuum from facts to plans to imagined pasts in one cohesive guide.
- **Key sections:** Routine facts (zero) and real future choices (first/future) with practice, second + third conditionals (imagining vs reflecting) with modal softeners, and a review checklist that links each type to housing, jobs, and health scenarios.
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** Housing routines (“If the landlord lists the apartment, we call right away”), Jobs and workplace development (“If I get hired, I will negotiate childcare”), Future planning (“If I arrive early, I will finish paperwork”), Imagined change (“If I had childcare, I would apply for the day shift”; “If I had known about the job fair, I would have prepared ahead”).
- **Difficulty level:** Foundational practice (sentence completion) for high beginners and analytical rewriting tasks for upper-intermediate learners, plus modal pairing exercises that extend the practice level.
- **Addresses struggles:** Directly targets sentence structure, conjunction linking, nuance with modals, and progression from routine to goal-setting, including the imagined/regretful space students need to describe complex situations.

## Add

### 1. Relative Clauses for People, Places, and Services
- **Scope:** Fill the gap by teaching who/which/that/whose in defining and non-defining clauses so students can describe people, apartments, workplaces, and community services more fully.
- **Key sections:** Choosing the correct relative pronoun, subject vs. object clauses, reducing clauses ("The nurse who works at the clinic → The nurse working at the clinic"), and sentence-combining practice.
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** “The neighbor who organizes the block party lives above the laundromat,” “The clinic that opens early helps East Boston families,” “The employer whose schedule fits my childcare needs.”
- **Difficulty level:** Start with fill-in frames for high beginners; upper-intermediate students practice combining independent clauses and introducing whose/which with commas.
- **Addresses struggles:** Direct support for sentence structure, conjunctions, and the explicitly missing relative clause topic.

### 2. Prepositions of Time & Place for East Boston Living
- **Scope:** Expand beyond the existing “Gerunds & Prepositions” guide to cover core prepositions of time/place in one coherent reference.
- **Key sections:** Time expressions (at, on, in, during, until, from…to), place expressions (at the bus stop, in the apartment, near the park), directional language (toward, across, between), and guided practice aligning prepositions with verbs like live/meet/work.
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** January housing (move-in day: “We moved in on January 6,” “I met the landlord at the office”), February jobs (shift planning: “I work from 9 to 5,” “I arrive at the café before breakfast”), health appointments (arrive for vaccinations, wait in line with the nurse).
- **Difficulty level:** Visual timelines/maps and choice boards for high-beginner clarity; nuance tasks (over vs. above, since vs. for) for upper-intermediate.
- **Addresses struggles:** Targets preposition selection confusion and reinforces sentence structure within relevant themes.

### 3. Articles & References for Community Resources
- **Scope:** Provide the foundational article rules (a/an/the/zero) with a focus on describing East Boston landmarks, services, and routines.
- **Key sections:** Indefinite vs definite vs zero article, articles with proper nouns/abstract nouns, and common traps (e.g., “I work at the clinic” vs. “I go to the clinic”).
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** “I saw a counselor at the community center,” “The bus to Maverick Square leaves every 20 minutes,” “Community health fairs share resources for families.”
- **Difficulty level:** Controlled practice for high beginners; upper-intermediate extension includes mixing countable/uncountable nouns and determining when to drop the article.
- **Addresses struggles:** Strengthens basic grammar fluency so students can focus on more complex structures without article-related hesitations.

### 4. Sentence Structure & Conjunctions Toolkit
- **Scope:** Offer targeted support on word order, coordinating/subordinating conjunction use, and crafting complex sentences with multi-step reasoning.
- **Key sections:** Review of SVO word order, coordinating conjunctions (and/but/because/so), subordinating conjunctions (after, before, although, since), sentence rearranging (move adverbs, connectors), and guided rewriting using theme-based prompts.
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** Housing process (“First we tour apartments, then we sign the lease because it is affordable”), job application steps (“I send the resume and follow up, but I also practice interview answers”), health choices (“I rest when I’m tired so I recover faster”).
- **Difficulty level:** Sentence strip matching for high-beginners and guided paragraph building (topic sentence + supporting clauses) for upper-intermediate.
- **Addresses struggles:** Direct practice with sentence structure, use of conjunctions, and preparation for later relative clause and conditional work.

### 5. Modal Meaning Spectrum: Ability, Advice, Probability, Necessity
- **Scope:** Create a broad modal verbs guide that complements and extends the existing obligation/permission guide so students see how modals change meaning across contexts.
- **Key sections:** Meaning-driven modal table (can/can’t/could/might/will/would/should/must/need to/ought to), strength/softness continuum, modals paired with conditionals and relative clauses, and role-play prompts for giving advice, expressing ability, or making polite requests.
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** “You must bring your ID to the housing meeting,” “I might have time to volunteer,” “Could you tell me which clinic stays open late?” “We should keep practicing English before the job fair.”
- **Difficulty level:** Core matching and choice tasks for high beginners; upper-intermediate students rewrite sentences with different modals to express probability or soften statements.
- **Addresses struggles:** Tackles nuanced modal meanings and links them to sentence structure, prepping students for more advanced conditionals and reports.

## Modify

### 1. Theme & Level Alignment for Non-Tense Guides
- **Scope:** Refresh the 16 existing non-tense grammar guides so every example, dialogue, and practice activity ties explicitly to the Jan–Jun themes (housing, jobs, workplace, health, holistic care, wrap-up) and offers “Core” vs. “Stretch” prompts per guide.
- **Key sections:** Add a “Community Connection” callout per guide that references East Boston (e.g., “Describe housing needs with articles/prepositions,” “Ask about job responsibilities using information questions,” “Share health goals using sentence structure”), plus “Level-Up” sections with optional challenges.
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** Map each guide to relevant months—January (housing articles/prepositions), February (jobs modals/gerunds), March (workplace conditionals and relative clauses), April (health reported speech/passive), May (holistic reflection and modals for advice), June (wrap-up reviews).
- **Difficulty level:** Built-in scaffolds ensure high beginners can use frames and sentence starters, while upper-intermediate students practice expansions and self-editing.
- **Addresses struggles:** Keeps contexts purposeful, prevents cognitive overload by showing why each guide matters, and makes mixed-level pacing manageable.

### 2. Expand the Existing Modals Guide
- **Scope:** Reframe “Modals: Obligation & Permission” so it previews the new modal spectrum guide, includes real community/housing/health contexts, and reinforces scaffolding for mixed-level groups.
- **Key sections:** Reinforced obligation/permission patterns, comparison tables linking obligation ↔ advice/probability, and “Switch the meaning” tasks that encourage students to change modals within the same sentence.
- **Suggested contexts/examples:** “You must submit the housing form,” “You can visit the job center after your evening class,” “You should rest if you feel sick,” plus stretch prompts (e.g., “How might you politely refuse overtime?”).
- **Difficulty level:** Simple slot fills for beginners, guided rewriting and peer teaching for advanced learners.
- **Addresses struggles:** Prevents modals from being pigeonholed, ensures continuity with the new modal spectrum resource, and layers difficulty intentionally.

## Organize

1. **January – Housing (Cycle 1 Wrap-Up):** Finish the month with *Cycle 1 Review*. Because *Parts of Speech* and *Superlatives & Quantifiers* are already in place, focus the remaining sessions on *Articles & References*, *Prepositions of Time & Place*, and *Sentence Structure & Conjunctions* so students describe apartments, move-in routines, and neighborhoods with clarity before Cycle 2 begins in February.
2. **February – Jobs:** Layer the *Gerunds & Infinitives Patterns* guide plus the refreshed *Modals: Obligation & Permission* and new *Modal Meaning Spectrum* resource. Tie *Information Questions* and *Conditionals Continuum* previews to job-seeking language and community services while adding focused introductions/practice for *Past Perfect* and *Future Perfect* so students can narrate work histories and future goals.
3. **March – Workplace Development:** Teach full *Conditionals Continuum*, introduce *Relative Clauses*, and use *Gerunds & Infinitives* practice to describe workplace habits. Leverage targeted *Sentence Structure* exercises to combine clauses for interviews or advocacy role-plays.
4. **April – Health:** Connect *Passive Voice*, *Reported Speech*, and the *Modal Spectrum* to health topics (appointments, instructions, advice). Use *Prepositions* and *Articles* in clinic-visit narratives and encourage upper-intermediate answering with relative clauses.
5. **May – Holistic Health & Review:** Revisit combined guides (gerunds/conditionals/relative clauses) in holistic-health contexts, restructure *Workplace Phrasal Verbs* and *Superlatives & Quantifiers* practice around wellness goals, and scaffold review activities for mixed levels.
6. **June – Wrap-Up & Academic Goals:** Use *Cycle 1 Review*, *Paragraph Format*, and *Future Conditional* to help students set academic goals for the next term, referencing their growth in sentence structure, modals, and relative clauses.

This sequence spaces the new and combined guides across the spring themes, keeps each month’s lessons purposeful, and ensures both high beginners and upper-intermediate learners see a clear progression rather than a long list of disconnected topics. Cycle 1 closes in late January; Cycle 2 launches with the February content described above.

## Suggested Twice-Weekly Rhythm (Tuesdays & Thursdays)

Align each meeting with the official Tuesday/Thursday 6:00–8:15 PM cadence shown in `class_uploads/ESOL_3_Calendar_Jan-Jun_2026.html:552` so planning maps directly onto the published calendar.

| Month | Tuesday focus | Thursday focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| January (Housing) | Finish *Cycle 1 Review*, then launch *Articles & References for Community Resources* and *Prepositions of Time & Place*; practice describing apartments, utilities, and East Boston routines with guided sentence frames that build on the Parts of Speech/Superlatives & Quantifiers work already completed earlier in the month. | Reinforce *Sentence Structure & Conjunctions* with housing scenarios; pair connectors with relative-phrase preview work so students can describe the landlord, neighborhood, and move-in process. |
| February (Jobs) | Teach the combined *Gerunds & Infinitives Patterns* guide through application/goals language and job search routines; add Past Perfect storytelling to describe career histories. | Extend the refreshed *Modals: Obligation & Permission* guide and introduce the *Modal Meaning Spectrum* so students can frame workplace expectations and polite requests while adding Future Perfect goal-setting language. |
| March (Workplace Development) | Deliver the first half of the *Conditionals Continuum* (zero + first) with workplace/community planning; integrate modal review and job-focused prompts. | Cover second conditional and *Relative Clauses* so students craft richer workplace narratives and policy proposals, then practice editing for accuracy. |
| April (Health) | Apply the *Modal Meaning Spectrum* to appointments, advice, and probability statements (can/might/should); include *Prepositions of Time & Place* review for clinic visits. | Pair *Passive Voice* or *Reported Speech* examples with relative clause work in health stories; offer stretch tasks that combine modals, conditionals, and clause reduction. |
| May (Holistic Health) | Revisit *Gerunds & Infinitives*, *Conditionals*, and *Relative Clauses* in holistic health reflections; provide mixed-level “core” vs “stretch” prompts. | Embed *Workplace Phrasal Verbs* or *Superlatives & Quantifiers* into wellness goals while students draft short plans using sentence-structure scaffolds. |
| June (Wrap-Up / Academic Goals) | Use *Cycle 1 Review* and *Paragraph Format* to revisit key structures and scaffold academic-goal writing; tie in *Future Conditional* for planning next steps. | Culminate with collective reflection (peer teaching, error analysis) so students articulate growth across modals, conditionals, and structure; finish with a preview of the new guides coming next cycle. |

Note: Cycle 1 ends in late January; the February entries mark the launch of Cycle 2.

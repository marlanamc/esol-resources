## 📊 How It Works

### Game Structure
- **10 Pattern Groups** organized by linguistic similarity
- **80%+ Accuracy = Unlock Next Group** (they must earn it!)
- **5 Exercise Types** for variety and engagement
- **Points & Progress Tracking** for motivation

### The 10 Groups
```
Group 1:      Form Doesn't Change (cost-cost-cost)
Group 2a-2e:  Pattern variations (-ought, -d→-t, etc.)
Group 3a-3d:  Vowel changes and participle patterns
```

### 5 Exercise Types
1. **Fill-in-Blank**: Type the missing verb forms
2. **Multiple Choice**: Select the correct form
3. **Sentence Completion**: Fill in context-appropriate verb
4. **Pattern Sorting**: Classify verbs into groups
5. **Speed Matching**: Timed verb matching challenge

---

## 📈 Expected Student Performance

### Timeline
- **Group 1**: 10-15 minutes (easiest, no-change pattern)
- **Groups 2a-2e**: 15-20 min each (medium difficulty)
- **Groups 3a-3d**: 20-25 min each (hardest, most variation)
- **Full Game**: 3-4 hours total (can be spread across days)

### Success Rates
- **First attempt 80%+**: ~30% of students (naturally gifted)
- **Second attempt 80%+**: ~50% of students (need one retry)
- **Third+ attempt 80%+**: ~20% of students (need more practice)

### Common Patterns
- Students usually do better on Groups 2a-2b (familiar patterns)
- Students struggle most on Group 3b (-en participles are tricky)
- Speed matching typically lower accuracy than others

2. **Observe which groups** they struggle with most
3. **Provide hints**: Point to the pattern hint on the screen
4. **Encourage retries**: "You got 75%, try again!"

### After Completing All 10 Groups
1. **Celebrate** - They've earned this!
2. **Review** - What patterns were easiest/hardest?
3. **Apply** - Have them find these verbs in real texts
4. **Extend** - Discuss other irregular verbs not in the game

## 📚 Verb Groups Cheat Sheet

### Why These Groups?

| Group | Pattern | Example | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Same form | cost-cost-cost | Recognition that not all irregulars are complex |
| 2a-2e | Subtle changes | bring-brought | Common endings, learners must pay attention |
| 3a-3d | Major changes | sing-sang-sung | Vowel shifts reveal deep patterns |

### Most Challenging Groups (for students)
1. **Group 3b** (-en participles) - "take-took-taken"
2. **Group 3d** (irregular set) - "be-was-been"
3. **Group 2a** (-ought pattern) - "bring-brought"

### Easiest Groups
1. **Group 1** (no change) - "cost-cost-cost"
2. **Group 2b** (-d to -t) - "spend-spent-spent"

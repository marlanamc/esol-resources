These comparisons are essential for describing your life, making decisions, and explaining situations.</p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Whether you're apartment hunting, job searching, or just describing your day, you need to compare and quantify. This lesson gives you the tools to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Find the best deal</strong> - Compare apartments, jobs, prices</li>
                    <li><strong>Make informed decisions</strong> - "Which option has the most advantages?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Describe situations accurately</strong> - "I have too much work and too little time"</li>
                    <li><strong>Negotiate effectively</strong> - At work, at stores, with landlords</li>
                </ul>

                <div style="background: rgba(122, 143, 124, 0.15); border-left: 4px solid #7ba884; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">

                    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">
                        <li>Describing your home ("My apartment is the quietest one in the building")</li>
                        <li>Comparing apartments ("This one has fewer bedrooms but more space")</li>
                        <li>Talking about food and restaurants ("Which restaurant has the best prices?")</li>
                        <li>Speaking game: Comparing homes and neighborhoods</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #3a3a3a;">💡 Tip: When you're apartment hunting or job searching, these comparisons help you explain your choices and find the best option!</p>

    TEACHER DIAGNOSTIC NOTES – Superlatives & Quantifiers Mini Quiz

    This mini quiz checks whether students can:
    - Form superlatives correctly with short adjectives (-est), long adjectives (most/least), and irregular adjectives (good → best).
    - Distinguish countable vs uncountable nouns and choose the correct quantifiers (many/much, few/little, fewer/less).
    - Use a few vs few and a little vs little to show positive vs negative meaning.
    - Combine superlatives and quantifiers in real-life situations (jobs, apartments, neighborhoods).

    Skill tags:

    Superlatives
    - superlative-short-adjective-est
    - superlative-long-adjective-most
    - superlative-irregular-good-best
    - superlative-most-space-fewest-problems
    - superlative-most-least-jobs
    - superlative-least-uncount-crime

    Quantifiers – count vs uncountable
    - quantifier-much-uncount-experience
    - quantifier-fewer-count-hours
    - quantifier-little-uncount-time-negative
    - quantifier-few-negative-apartments
    - quantifier-a-few-positive-friends
    - quantifier-a-little-positive-help
    - quantifier-little-negative-patience
    - quantifier-less-uncount-experience-comparison
    - fewer-vs-less-benefits-count

    How to read the diagnostics:
    - If superlative tags are weak (superlative-short-adjective-est, superlative-long-adjective-most, superlative-irregular-good-best, superlative-most-space-fewest-problems, superlative-most-least-jobs, superlative-least-uncount-crime) →
      Rebuild the superlative chart:
      • Short adjectives (1 syllable): the + adj + -est → the cheapest, the busiest.
      • Long adjectives (2+ syllables): the most/least + adj → the most expensive, the least crowded.
      • Irregular: good → the best, bad → the worst.
      Practice with real examples from housing and jobs: cheapest apartment, most experience, least traffic, most vacation days.

    - If basic quantifier tags are weak (quantifier-much-uncount-experience, quantifier-fewer-count-hours, quantifier-little-uncount-time-negative, quantifier-less-uncount-experience-comparison, fewer-vs-less-benefits-count) →
      Go back to countable vs uncountable:
      • Countable: use many/few/fewer (jobs, hours, benefits).
      • Uncountable: use much/little/less (money, time, experience, patience).
      Use a T-chart on the board with real nouns from students' lives (jobs, hours, rent, traffic) and sort them together.

    - If a few vs few or a little vs little tags are weak (quantifier-a-few-positive-friends, quantifier-few-negative-apartments, quantifier-a-little-positive-help, quantifier-little-negative-patience) →
      Contrast positive vs negative meaning:
      • a few / a little = some (enough, positive).
      • few / little = almost none (not enough, negative).
      Have students write pairs:
      • I have a few friends here. (positive)
      • I have few friends here. (negative)
      • I have a little time. (positive)
      • I have little time. (negative)

    - If combined superlative + quantifier tags are weak (superlative-most-space-fewest-problems, superlative-most-least-jobs, superlative-least-uncount-crime) →
      Use comparison tables:
      • Compare 3 job offers (pay, hours, vacation, experience).
      • Compare 3 apartments (rooms, rent, problems, space).
      Ask students to write sentences using:
      • the most + count/uncount (the most vacation days, the most space).
      • the least + uncount (the least experience, the least crime).
      • the fewest + count (the fewest problems, the fewest bedrooms).

    Suggested use:
    - Use this mini quiz after students have:
      • Reviewed superlative formation (short/long/irregular).
      • Practiced count vs uncountable nouns.
      • Practiced many/much, few/little, fewer/less, most/least.
    - At the class level:
      • If superlatives are red, spend more time on short vs long adjective patterns with real housing and job examples.
      • If quantifiers are red, slow down and do quick daily warm ups sorting nouns into countable/uncountable, then choose many/much/few/little/fewer/less.
      • If the positive vs negative forms (a few vs few, a little vs little) are red, use simple feelings-based examples (lonely, rushed, happy, relaxed) to make the meaning contrast clear.

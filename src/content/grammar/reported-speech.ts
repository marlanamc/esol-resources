            explanation: `
                <h3>Mistake #1: Using "to" with "said"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "She said <strong>to me</strong> that..." → ✅ "She said that..." OR "She told me that..."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #2: Forgetting the object with "told"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "He told that he was sick." → ✅ "He told <strong>me</strong> that he was sick."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #3: Not backshifting tenses</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "She said she <strong>is</strong> tired." → ✅ "She said she <strong>was</strong> tired."</li>
                    <li>❌ "He said he <strong>will</strong> call." → ✅ "He said he <strong>would</strong> call."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #4: Wrong structure for commands</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "She told me <strong>that</strong> take the medicine." → ✅ "She told me <strong>to take</strong> the medicine."</li>
                    <li>❌ "They said me <strong>to</strong> come back." → ✅ "They told me <strong>to</strong> come back."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #5: Not changing pronouns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "The doctor said <strong>you</strong> need rest." → ✅ "The doctor said <strong>I</strong> needed rest."</li>

    TEACHER DIAGNOSTIC NOTES – Reported Speech Mini Quiz

    This mini quiz checks whether students can:
    - Choose the correct structure with say and tell in reported speech.
    - Backshift tenses correctly when reporting from the past.
    - Report commands and requests with told/asked + person + to + verb and NOT to + verb.
    - Change pronouns and time words correctly.
    - Avoid common error patterns like said to me that and will or can staying in the present.
    - Apply these rules to real world messages from supervisors, clinics, receptionists, and clerks.

    Skill tags:

    Say vs tell
    - say-vs-tell-tell-with-object
    - say-vs-tell-say-with-that
    - avoid-said-to-me-that

    Backshifting tenses
    - backshift-present-be-to-past
    - backshift-will-to-would-time-tomorrow-next-day
    - backshift-can-to-could
    - backshift-must-to-had-to
    - backshift-present-to-past-with-now-then
    - backshift-present-simple-negative-to-past
    - no-backshift-still-true-exception

    Commands and requests
    - reported-command-asked-person-to-verb
    - reported-command-negative-not-to-verb
    - reported-speech-message-backshift-and-command

    Pronouns and time words
    - pronoun-change-you-to-I
    - time-word-today-to-that-day

    How to read the diagnostics:
    - If say vs tell tags are weak (say-vs-tell-tell-with-object, say-vs-tell-say-with-that, avoid-said-to-me-that) →
      Go back to the core contrast:
      • Say + that + statement, no person: She said that the office was closed.
      • Tell + person + that + statement: She told me that the office was closed.
      Use short correction drills with common mistakes:
      • She said me that... → She said that...
      • He told that... → He told me that...

    - If backshifting tags are weak (backshift-present-be-to-past, backshift-will-to-would-time-tomorrow-next-day, backshift-can-to-could, backshift-must-to-had-to, backshift-present-to-past-with-now-then, backshift-present-simple-negative-to-past) →
      Rebuild the mini chart from the guide:
      • am/is/are → was/were
      • will → would
      • can → could
      • must → had to
      • now → then, today → that day, tomorrow → the next day
      Have students work in pairs. One student says a direct sentence, the other reports it with the correct backshift. Then switch roles.

    - If the still true exception tag is weak (no-backshift-still-true-exception) →
      Practice with personal facts that are still true:
      • Direct: "Class starts at 6 PM."
      • Reported now: She said class starts at 6 PM.
      Contrast with information that is finished:
      • Direct: "We are short staffed today."
      • Reported later: She said they were short staffed that day.

    - If command and request tags are weak (reported-command-asked-person-to-verb, reported-command-negative-not-to-verb, reported-speech-message-backshift-and-command) →
      Reuse clinic and workplace examples:
      • Direct: "Please bring your ID." → Reported: She asked me to bring my ID.
      • Direct: "Do not eat before the test." → Reported: They told me not to eat before the test.
      Have students underline the person and the verb in each sentence and write their own real commands and requests from work or appointments.

    - If pronoun and time word tags are weak (pronoun-change-you-to-I, time-word-today-to-that-day) →
      Build two mini tables on the board:

      Pronouns:
      • I → he/she
      • you → I/me
      • we → they
      • my → his/her

      Time words:
      • today → that day
      • tomorrow → the next day
      • yesterday → the day before
      • now → then

      Have students transform short quotes and focus only on pronouns and time words first, then add tense changes later.

    Suggested use:
    - Use this mini quiz after students have worked through:
      • Direct vs reported speech.
      • Say vs tell.
      • Tense backshifting.
      • Reported commands and requests.
      • Pronoun and time word changes.
    - At the class level:
      • If say vs tell is red, slow down and practice with simple workplace and clinic sentences where students choose between said and told.
      • If backshifting is red, spend more time on the tense chart and oral drilling before long writing tasks.
      • If commands and requests are red, do more role plays with receptionists, doctors, supervisors, and family members using told/asked + person + to + verb.
      • If pronouns and time words are red, strip sentences down to just pronoun and time word changes until this feels automatic, then add the full reported sentences.

    Reteaching guidance:
    - If meaning/sequence tags are weak → go back to the TWO-VERB RULE and have students label FIRST and SECOND actions on a timeline.
    - If duration tags are weak → drill for vs since and HOW LONG questions anchored to a later past event (when, by the time, before).
    - If form tags are weak → practice had been + verb-ing across subjects in positive, negative, and question forms.
    - If pattern tags are weak → build sentence frames with "by the time" and "when" plus Past Perfect Continuous + Past Simple.
    - If contrast tags are weak → compare pairs like "was waiting" vs "had been waiting" and ask: "Am I talking about what was happening at that moment, or how long before it?"
    - If stative-verb errors appear → review common stative verbs (know, like, love, believe, understand) and replace Past Perfect Continuous with Past Perfect Simple in those cases.

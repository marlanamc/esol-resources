                    <h4 style="color: #22c55e; margin-top: 0;">💡 ADVICE (should/shouldn't)</h4>
                    <p>Recommendations that are good for your health, but not required:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You <strong>should</strong> drink plenty of water.</li>
                        <li>You <strong>should</strong> get 7-8 hours of sleep.</li>

                    <h4 style="color: #dc2626; margin-top: 0;">⚠️ CAUTION (must/must not)</h4>
                    <p>Required actions or dangerous prohibitions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You <strong>must</strong> take this medicine exactly as prescribed.</li>

                    <h4 style="color: #3b82f6; margin-top: 0;">✅ CONSENT (can/may/are allowed to)</h4>
                    <p>What you're permitted to do or request:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You <strong>can</strong> ask questions at any time.</li>

                <h3>Key Grammar Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Subject + modal + base verb (no -s, no -ing!)</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative:</strong> modal + not → shouldn't, mustn't, can't, don't need to</li>
                    <li><strong>Questions:</strong> Modal + subject + base verb? → Can I...? Should I...? May I...?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "You shoulds take it" → ✅ "You should take it" (no -s on modals)</li>
                    <li>❌ "You must to finish" → ✅ "You must finish" OR "You need to finish" (no 'to' after must)</li>
                    <li>❌ "You don't must" → ✅ "You must not" OR "You don't have to" (correct negative forms)</li>
                    <li>❌ "Can you helping me?" → ✅ "Can you help me?" (base verb after modal)</li>

    TEACHER DIAGNOSTIC NOTES – Modals for Health: Advice, Caution & Consent Mini Quiz

    This mini quiz checks whether students can:
    - Understand the meaning difference between SHOULD, MUST, CAN, MAY, NEED TO, and DON'T NEED TO.
    - Choose the correct modal for advice, safety warnings, necessity, permission, and rights.
    - Use the correct grammar pattern: modal + base verb (no -s, no -ing, no 'to').
    - Distinguish between:
      • MUST NOT (forbidden/dangerous) vs DON'T NEED TO (not required).
      • CAN (informal permission) vs MAY (formal permission) vs ARE ALLOWED TO (rights).
    - Apply these forms to real healthcare contexts: labels, clinic visits, records, translators.

    Skill tags:

    Meaning: advice, caution, necessity, permission, rights
    - meaning-advice-should
    - meaning-caution-must-not
    - meaning-necessity-need-to
    - meaning-necessity-dont-need-to
    - contrast-should-vs-must-meaning
    - contrast-dont-need-to-vs-must-not

    Form: modal + base verb
    - form-modal-plus-base-verb
    - form-must-not-plus-base-verb
    - form-modal-question-can-plus-base-verb

    Permission and politeness
    - permission-may-formal-polite
    - permission-can-informal-visit
    - permission-may-request-records-formal

    Rights and healthcare access
    - rights-are-allowed-to-health-records
    - rights-are-allowed-to-translator

    Label and context meaning
    - label-advice-should-with-food
    - label-warning-must-not-drive

    How to read the diagnostics:
    - If advice vs must tags are weak (meaning-advice-should, contrast-should-vs-must-meaning) →
      Rebuild the ADVICE vs MUST chart from the guide:
      • SHOULD = recommended (good idea).
      • MUST / NEED TO = required/necessary.
      Use real sentences from the guide and have students sort them into ADVICE vs REQUIRED.

    - If safety warning tags are weak (meaning-caution-must-not, label-warning-must-not-drive) →
      Focus on MUST NOT vs SHOULD NOT vs DON'T NEED TO:
      • MUST NOT = dangerous/forbidden.
      • SHOULD NOT = advice (not a good idea).
      • DON'T NEED TO = not required.
      Highlight warning icons and colors on labels so students connect grammar to safety.

    - If necessity tags are weak (meaning-necessity-need-to, meaning-necessity-dont-need-to, contrast-dont-need-to-vs-must-not) →
      Make a three-column chart:
      • REQUIRED: must / need to.
      • NOT REQUIRED: don't need to.
      • FORBIDDEN: must not.
      Have students place real health sentences in the correct column and explain why.

    - If form tags are weak (form-modal-plus-base-verb, form-must-not-plus-base-verb, form-modal-question-can-plus-base-verb) →
      Go back to the pattern:
      Subject + modal + base verb.
      Do quick board drills correcting mistakes:
      • You shoulds to take → You should take.
      • You must not to drive → You must not drive.
      • Can you explaining → Can you explain.

    - If permission and politeness tags are weak (permission-may-formal-polite, permission-can-informal-visit, permission-may-request-records-formal) →
      Contrast:
      • Clinic room, quick question → CAN I...?
      • Front desk / records / policy questions → MAY I...?
      Practice short role-plays:
      • Patient with doctor (Can I ask you a question?).
      • Patient with receptionist (May I request access to my records?).

    - If rights tags are weak (rights-are-allowed-to-health-records, rights-are-allowed-to-translator) →
      Review the rights section in the guide.
      Ask students to underline or highlight sentences with 'are allowed to' and rewrite them
      as simple rights statements:
      • You are allowed to see your records.
      • You are allowed to request a translator.

    Suggested use:
    - Use this mini quiz after students complete the sections on:
      • Advice (should/shouldn't).
      • Caution (must/must not).
      • Consent and rights (can/may/are allowed to).
      • Necessity (need to/don't need to).
    - At the class level:
      • If meaning tags are red → focus on meaning charts, picture prompts, and scenario sorting activities.
      • If form tags are red → do more short, high-repetition drills with the modal + base verb pattern.
      • If rights/permission tags are red → spend time on patient rights, practice real sentences students can use in clinics and hospitals.

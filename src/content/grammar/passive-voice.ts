                <h3>Reason #1: The Doer Is Unknown or Unimportant</h3>
                <div style="background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <p>When we don't know who did the action, or it doesn't matter:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"My car <strong>was stolen</strong>." (We don't know who stole it)</li>
                        <li>"The clinic <strong>was built</strong> in 1995." (Builder doesn't matter)</li>
                        <li>"Your prescription <strong>was sent</strong> to the pharmacy." (Who sent it? Doesn't matter)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Reason #2: Focus on the Action, Not the Person</h3>
                <div style="background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <p>Medical instructions focus on WHAT happens to you, not WHO does it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Your blood pressure <strong>will be checked</strong>." (The action is what matters)</li>
                        <li>"The test <strong>is performed</strong> in the lab." (How it's done is what matters)</li>
                        <li>"You <strong>will be contacted</strong> with results." (What happens to you matters)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Reason #3: Scientific/Formal Writing</h3>
                <div style="background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <p>Passive is common in formal instructions, signs, and procedures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"This medication <strong>should be taken</strong> with food." (medication label)</li>
                        <li>"Patients <strong>must be registered</strong> before their appointment." (clinic sign)</li>
                        <li>"The area <strong>was cleaned</strong> and sterilized." (procedure report)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>When NOT to Use Passive</h3>
                <div style="background: rgba(200, 107, 81, 0.1); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <p><strong>Use active voice when the doer IS important:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ ACTIVE: "<strong>Dr. Smith</strong> prescribed this medication." (specific doctor matters)</li>
                        <li>❌ PASSIVE: "This medication was prescribed." (too vague if you need to know who)</li>

                <h3>Mistake #1: Forgetting "be"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "The test <strong>performed</strong> yesterday." → ✅ "The test <strong>was performed</strong> yesterday."</li>
                    <li>❌ "You <strong>called</strong> tomorrow." → ✅ "You <strong>will be called</strong> tomorrow."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #2: Wrong Tense of "be"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "The medicine <strong>is taken</strong> yesterday." → ✅ "The medicine <strong>was taken</strong> yesterday."</li>
                    <li>❌ "Results <strong>were sent</strong> tomorrow." → ✅ "Results <strong>will be sent</strong> tomorrow."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #3: Using Wrong Past Participle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "My blood was <strong>drew</strong>." → ✅ "My blood was <strong>drawn</strong>."</li>
                    <li>❌ "I was <strong>gave</strong> medication." → ✅ "I was <strong>given</strong> medication."</li>
                    <li>❌ "The form was <strong>wrote</strong>." → ✅ "The form was <strong>written</strong>."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #4: Overusing Passive</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ PASSIVE: "A prescription was given to me by Dr. Smith." (too wordy)</li>
                    <li>✅ ACTIVE: "Dr. Smith gave me a prescription." (clearer, simpler)</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Use passive when the doer is unimportant. Use active when the doer matters.</strong></p>

    TEACHER DIAGNOSTIC NOTES – Passive Voice Mini Quiz

    This mini quiz checks whether students can:
    - Recognize passive voice in medical sentences and clinic language.
    - Form present, past, future, and modal passive correctly (be + past participle).
    - Use irregular past participles correctly in passive (drawn, given, written, etc.).
    - Understand when passive is appropriate (focus on action/receiver) and when active is better (doer is important).
    - Avoid common errors: missing "be", wrong tense of "be", wrong past participle, or unnatural overuse of passive.

    Skill tags:

    Identifying passive vs active
    - identify-passive-basic
    - identify-passive-medical-signs
    - choose-active-when-doer-important
    - reason-use-passive-medical-context

    Forming passive in different tenses
    - form-present-simple-passive-medical
    - form-past-simple-passive-medical
    - form-future-passive-medical
    - form-modal-passive-medical
    - convert-active-to-passive-medical
    - form-passive-with-by-agent

    Irregular past participles and aspect
    - irregular-past-participle-write
    - identify-present-perfect-passive
    - negative-present-perfect-passive
    - question-form-past-passive

    Common error patterns
    - avoid-wrong-past-participle
    - avoid-missing-be-or-base-form

    How to read the diagnostics:
    - If basic identification tags are weak (identify-passive-basic, identify-passive-medical-signs, reason-use-passive-medical-context) →
      Revisit the core contrast:
      • Active: subject does the action (The nurse drew my blood).
      • Passive: subject receives the action (My blood was drawn).
      Highlight subject, verb, and object in pairs of sentences and ask: Who does the action? Who receives it?

    - If tense/form tags are weak (form-present-simple-passive-medical, form-past-simple-passive-medical, form-future-passive-medical, form-modal-passive-medical, convert-active-to-passive-medical, form-passive-with-by-agent) →
      Build a passive mini-chart on the board using medical examples:
      • Present: is/are + past participle (Forms are checked).
      • Past: was/were + past participle (My ID was checked).
      • Future: will be + past participle (You will be called).
      • Modal: must/should/can + be + past participle (This form must be completed).
      Then do quick transformations: give an active sentence and have students say the passive version aloud before writing.

    - If irregular participle and aspect tags are weak (irregular-past-participle-write, identify-present-perfect-passive, negative-present-perfect-passive, question-form-past-passive) →
      Focus on a small irregular list that actually appears in medical English:
      • draw → drawn, give → given, write → written, send → sent, tell → told.
      Practice short substitution drills:
      • My blood was ____ yesterday. (drawn)
      • The note has been ____ for you. (written)
      • The results have not been ____ yet. (sent)

    - If error-pattern tags are weak (avoid-wrong-past-participle, avoid-missing-be-or-base-form) →
      Use "fix the sentence" activities:
      • The test performed yesterday. → The test was performed yesterday.
      • I was gave medication. → I was given medication.
      Ask students to circle the form of "be" and underline the past participle in each corrected sentence.

    - If "choose-active-when-doer-important" is weak →
      Contrast pairs:
      • Passive: The medication was prescribed. (Who?)
      • Active: Dr. Patel prescribed the medication. (Clear doer.)
      Have students decide: clinic sign or conversation with the doctor? Then choose active or passive.

    Suggested use:
    - Use this mini quiz after students have worked through:
      • Active vs passive section.
      • Forming passive in different tenses.
      • Medical context examples and common mistakes.
    - At the class level:
      • If identification is red but form is green → spend more time reading and noticing passive in real patient portal messages, signs, and labels.
      • If form is red (especially modals and future) → slow down and do more controlled transformation drills before freer production.
      • If error tags are red → integrate quick warm-ups where students correct 3–4 passive mistakes at the start of class using real medical-style sentences.

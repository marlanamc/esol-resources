                <h3>Reason #1: The Doer Is Unknown or Unimportant</h3>
                <div style="background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <p>When we don't know who did the action, or it doesn't matter:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"My car <strong>was stolen</strong>." (We don't know who stole it)</li>
                        <li>"The clinic <strong>was built</strong> in 1995." (Builder doesn't matter)</li>
                        <li>"Your prescription <strong>was sent</strong> to the pharmacy." (Who sent it? Doesn't matter)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Reason #2: Focus on the Action, Not the Person</h3>

                    <p>Medical instructions focus on WHAT happens to you, not WHO does it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Your blood pressure <strong>will be checked</strong>." (The action is what matters)</li>
                        <li>"The test <strong>is performed</strong> in the lab." (How it's done is what matters)</li>
                        <li>"You <strong>will be contacted</strong> with results." (What happens to you matters)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Reason #3: Scientific/Formal Writing</h3>
                <div style="background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <p>Passive is common in formal instructions, signs, and procedures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"This medication <strong>should be taken</strong> with food." (medication label)</li>
                        <li>"Patients <strong>must be registered</strong> before their appointment." (clinic sign)</li>
                        <li>"The area <strong>was cleaned</strong> and sterilized." (procedure report)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>When NOT to Use Passive</h3>

                    <p><strong>Use active voice when the doer IS important:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ ACTIVE: "<strong>Dr. Smith</strong> prescribed this medication." (specific doctor matters)</li>

                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Use passive when the doer is unimportant. Use active when the doer matters.</strong></p>

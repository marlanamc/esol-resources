                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Information questions (also called WH-questions) help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Get crucial information</strong> - About housing, jobs, healthcare, your rights</li>
                    <li><strong>Advocate for yourself</strong> - Ask follow-up questions when you don't understand</li>
                    <li><strong>Sound professional</strong> - In interviews, meetings, and important conversations</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid misunderstandings</strong> - Clarify details before it's too late</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Standard Word Order</h3>
                <p><strong>WH-word + Helping Verb + Subject + Main Verb + ?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where <em>do</em> you live?</li>
                    <li>When <em>does</em> the lease start?</li>
                    <li>What <em>is</em> the deposit?</li>

                <h3>Exception: Who is the Doer?</h3>
                <p><strong>Who/What + Verb + ?</strong> (NO helping verb when who/what is the doer)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who pays utilities? <span style="color: #718096; font-size: 0.95rem;">→ The doer is "Who"</span></li>

                <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "Where you live?" → ✅ "Where do you live?" (need helping verb)</li>
                    <li>❌ "How much bedrooms?" → ✅ "How many bedrooms?" (bedrooms are countable)</li>
                    <li>❌ "Who does pay rent?" → ✅ "Who pays rent?" (The doer is "Who", no "do")</li>
                    <li>❌ "What is the rent costs?" → ✅ "How much is the rent?" OR "What does the rent cost?"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Making Questions More Polite</h3>
                <p>In English, asking questions directly can sometimes sound a bit demanding. To be extra professional and polite (at work, at the doctor, or with landlords), we often use <strong>Indirect Questions</strong>.</p>

                <div style="background: #fdf6e3; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #b58900; border-radius: 0.3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p style="margin-top: 0; font-weight: 600;">🛑 Stop and Think:</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you are asking your boss about your paycheck, which sounds better? "Where is my check?" or "Could you tell me where my check is?"</p>
                </div>

                <div style="background: rgba(110, 145, 118, 0.1); border-left: 4px solid #7ba884; padding: 1.25rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    <h3 style="color: #7ba884; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">🧠 Think of Indirect Questions Like This</h3>
                    <p>An indirect question is:<br><strong>A polite sentence + a question inside it</strong></p>
                    <p>The question itself does NOT change.<br>It just goes inside a sentence.</p>

                <div style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #b58900; padding: 1.25rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-weight: 600; color: #856404;">⚠️ Important Reminder</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">Inside an indirect question, the word order is like a statement:<br><strong>subject + verb</strong></p>
                    <p style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0.5rem 0;"><strong>We say:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                        <li>where the office is</li>
                        <li>what time the clinic closes</li>
                        <li>how much the deposit is</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0.5rem 0;"><strong>NOT:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                        <li>where is the office</li>
                        <li>what time does the clinic close</li>
                        <li>how much does the deposit cost</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0;">This reinforces what you already taught, without reframing.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 600; color: #7ba884;">✅ Good to Know</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">If you accidentally use question word order in an indirect question, people will usually still understand you.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0;">Indirect questions are about being polite and professional, not about being perfect.</p>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.05rem;"><strong>Takeaway:</strong><br>In polite long questions, use statement word order inside the sentence.</p>

                <h3>Asking Follow-Up Questions</h3>
                <p>In professional situations (job interviews, doctor visits, landlord meetings), you need to ask <strong>3-4 follow-up questions</strong> to get the complete picture. This shows you're engaged and thinking critically.</p>

                        <p style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-weight: 600; color: #d97757;">Level 1 - Initial Question:</p>
                        <p style="margin: 0;">"What are the hours for this position?"</p>
                    </div>

                <h4>The 4-Level Question Strategy:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Initial:</strong> Ask the basic question (What? When? How much?)</li>
                    <li><strong>Clarify:</strong> Get specific details ("Does that include...?" "Is that...?")</li>
                    <li><strong>Dig deeper:</strong> Ask about flexibility, exceptions, options</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan ahead:</strong> "What if...?" "How would...?" "What would happen if...?"</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Why This Matters:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You avoid misunderstandings</strong> (don't assume - ask!)</li>
                    <li><strong>You show professionalism</strong> (employers/landlords see you're thoughtful)</li>
                    <li><strong>You make informed decisions</strong> (know all the facts before signing a lease or accepting a job)</li>
                </ul>

  TEACHER DIAGNOSTIC NOTES – Information Questions Mini Quiz

  This mini quiz checks whether students can:
  - Choose the correct WH-word (who/what/when/where/why/how).
  - Choose between HOW MUCH vs HOW MANY for money, time, and countable nouns.
  - Use the standard word order: WH-word + helping verb + subject + main verb.
  - Distinguish SUBJECT vs OBJECT questions with WHO.
  - Use WHAT vs WHICH based on how many choices they have.
  - Use statement word order inside indirect and embedded questions.
  - Apply this to real housing, landlord, and work situations.

  Skill tags:

  WH-word choice:
  - wh-choice-who-vs-what-when
  - wh-choice-how-method
  - wh-choice-why-reason

  How much / How many:
  - how-many-vs-how-much-countable
  - how-much-vs-how-many-uncountable

  Word order:
  - word-order-wh-aux-subject-verb

  Subject vs object questions:
  - subject-question-who-no-aux
  - object-question-who-does-do
  - object-question-who-do-i-contact

  What vs Which:
  - what-vs-which-limited-choice
  - what-vs-which-unlimited-choice

  Indirect & embedded questions:
  - indirect-question-statement-word-order
  - embedded-question-statement-word-order
  - politeness-indirect-vs-direct-question

  Housing / landlord context:
  - housing-context-which-utilities-included
  - housing-context-how-much-notice

  How to read the diagnostics:
  - If HOW MUCH / HOW MANY tags are weak →
    Re-teach the countable/uncountable contrast using money, rooms, people, time.
    Use housing examples: rent, deposit, notice, bedrooms, people.

  - If WH-choice tags are weak →
    Sort questions by type of information:
    • WHO → person
    • WHAT → thing/information
    • WHEN → time
    • WHERE → place
    • WHY → reason
    • HOW → method
    Have students match landlord/doctor/job questions to the right WH-word.

  - If word-order tags are weak →
    Go back to the core formula:
    WH-word + helping verb + subject + main verb + ?
    Do quick board drills starting from statements:
    • You pay rent on the first. → When do you pay rent?
    • The office is on the third floor. → Where is the office?

  - If subject/object WHO tags are weak →
    Use the “Who is the doer?” test:
    • If WHO is the doer → no DO/DOES (Who pays the rent?)
    • If YOU/another person is the doer → use DO/DOES (Who do you pay?)
    Practice turning one sentence into both a subject question and an object question.

  - If WHAT vs WHICH tags are weak →
    Practice with real objects in the room and housing images:
    • Many possible answers → WHAT apartment complex is this?
    • Small set of choices → WHICH apartment do you want, 3A or 3B?

  - If indirect/embedded tags are weak →
    Contrast pairs on the board:
    • Where is the office? → Could you tell me where the office is?
    • What time does the clinic close? → Do you know what time the clinic closes?
    Highlight that inside the longer sentence we use statement order (subject + verb).

  - If housing-context tags are weak →
    Revisit the “Essential Housing Questions” section.
    Have students build their own landlord question list and check each one for:
    • Correct WH-word.
    • Correct money/time word (How much / How many).
    • Correct word order.

  Suggested use:
  - Use this mini quiz after students have completed the main sections:
    WH-words, How much/How many, word order, subject/object questions, What vs Which,
    and indirect/embedded questions.
  - At the class level, use skillTag patterns to decide:
    • If WH-choice and How much/How many are red → do more controlled grammar drills.
    • If indirect/embedded and politeness tags are red → focus on role-plays with bosses,
      landlords, and doctors using indirect questions.
    • If housing-context tags are red → repeat the landlord interview activity and
      have students rewrite their questions using correct forms.

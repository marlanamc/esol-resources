                    <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; margin-bottom: 0;">Every sentence you speak is built from <strong>eight essential building blocks</strong>: <span style="color: #3b82f6;">nouns</span>, <span style="color: #dc2626;">verbs</span>, <span style="color: #16a34a;">adjectives</span>, <span style="color: #9333ea;">adverbs</span>, <span style="color: #0f766e;">pronouns</span>, <span style="color: #92400e;">articles</span>, <span style="color: #334155;">prepositions</span>, and <span style="color: #db2777;">conjunctions</span>. Understanding these parts helps you build stronger, clearer sentences.</p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Parts of speech are the foundation of everything in English:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Building sentences:</strong> You need to know what type of word goes where</li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding grammar:</strong> Most grammar rules are based on parts of speech</li>
                    <li><strong>Expanding vocabulary:</strong> One word can change forms (work → worker → working)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixing mistakes:</strong> Knowing parts of speech helps you spot and fix errors</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3 style="color: #7ba884; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">🗣️ When You'll Use This Grammar</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>In class:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                        <li>Understanding classroom instructions ("Use an <em>adjective</em> to describe it")</li>
                        <li>Building better sentences when you speak (knowing where each word type goes)</li>
                        <li>Learning grammar terminology so you can understand future lessons</li>
                        <li>Practicing question formation (you need to know what a "verb" and "noun" are!)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin: 1rem 0 0.5rem 0;"><strong>Throughout the course, you'll use this when:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">
                        <li><strong>Every week:</strong> Understanding what "gerund," "infinitive," "auxiliary verb," and "modal" mean</li>
                        <li><strong>Learning about gerunds vs infinitives</strong> (you need to know what a "verb" is first!)</li>
                        <li><strong>Understanding adverbs for workplace politeness:</strong> "Could you <em>possibly</em> help me?"</li>
                        <li><strong>Expanding vocabulary:</strong> If you know "happy" (adjective), you also know "happiness" (noun) and "happily" (adverb)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #3a3a3a;">🧱 Think of parts of speech as LEGO blocks - once you know what each piece does, you can build anything!</p>

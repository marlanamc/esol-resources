                <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(103, 119, 239, 0.1) 0%, rgba(255, 179, 71, 0.1) 100%); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; margin-bottom: 0;">Think of all the things you already did: you woke up late, you ate breakfast too fast, you missed the bus, you survived another day. Past Simple is how you tell those stories.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Past Simple is for actions that are finished. They're done, over, in the past. You use it every time you tell someone what happened yesterday, explain why you're late, or share what you did last weekend.</p>

                <div style="background: rgba(122, 143, 124, 0.15); border-left: 4px solid #7ba884; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    <h3 style="color: #7ba884; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">🗣️ When You'll Use This Grammar</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>In class:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                        <li>Telling problem stories about banking and shopping ("I went to the bank, but they charged me a fee")</li>
                        <li>Reporting what happened ("The cashier said..." "The manager told me...")</li>
                        <li>Explaining past events ("I called customer service, they didn't help, so I complained")</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin: 1rem 0 0.5rem 0;"><strong>You'll also use this when:</strong></p>

                        <li><strong>Telling detailed housing problem stories</strong> (past continuous + past simple together)</li>

    How to use this data:
    - If many students miss "form-negative-didnt-base-verb",
      review negative form: subject + didn't + base verb, and correct errors like "didn't went".
    - If scores are low on "contrast-past-simple-present-perfect", spend more time on
      finished time expressions (yesterday, last week, in 2022) versus life experience or present relevance.
    - If "meaning-story-sequence" is weak, practice short storytelling with ordered steps
      using Past Simple verbs in sequence (first, then, after that).
    - If "meaning-story-sequence-connectors" or "meaning-event-emotion-link" is weak, practice
      two-step storytelling frames: what happened first, and how did you feel.
    - If "pronunciation-ed-id" is weak, run quick sorting drills for -ed sounds (/t/, /d/, /id/)
      before speaking tasks so students can hear and produce endings clearly.
    - If "meaning-used-to-past-habit" is weak, contrast "used to + base verb" with one-time
      Past Simple events and drill the question pattern: Did you use to...?
    - If "form-irregular-family-pattern" is weak, teach irregulars in families (-ought/-aught,
      vowel-change, no-change verbs) instead of isolated memorization.

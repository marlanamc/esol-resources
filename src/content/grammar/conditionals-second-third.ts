                <p>Third conditional is for <strong>reflecting on the past</strong> - things that didn't happen and their imagined results:</p>

                    <li><strong>Regrets:</strong> "If I had saved money, I would have been able to buy a car."</li>
                    <li><strong>Different outcomes:</strong> "If we had left earlier, we wouldn't have missed the train."</li>

                <h3>Mistake #1: Using "would" in the IF clause</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "If I <strong>would have</strong> more money, I would travel." → ✅ "If I <strong>had</strong> more money, I would travel."</li>
                    <li>❌ "If I <strong>would have known</strong>, I would have called." → ✅ "If I <strong>had known</strong>, I would have called."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #2: Mixing up second and third conditional</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "If I had more time, I would have studied." (mixing tenses!)</li>
                    <li>✅ "If I had more time, I would study." (second - present/future hypothetical)</li>
                    <li>✅ "If I had had more time, I would have studied." (third - past regret)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #3: Using "was" instead of "were"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "If I <strong>was</strong> you, I would apologize."</li>
                    <li>✅ "If I <strong>were</strong> you, I would apologize."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mistake #4: Forgetting "have" in third conditional</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "If I had studied, I would passed." (missing "have"!)</li>
                    <li>✅ "If I had studied, I <strong>would have passed</strong>."</li>

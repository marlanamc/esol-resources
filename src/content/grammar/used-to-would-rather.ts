                    <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; margin-bottom: 0;">"I used to smoke, but I quit." "I'd rather walk than drive." These structures help you talk about how things were different in the past and what you prefer now. Essential for discussing health changes, work habits, and lifestyle improvements.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>These structures are critical for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Doctor visits:</strong> "I used to have headaches every day." "I'd rather try exercise before medication."</li>
                    <li><strong>Job interviews:</strong> "I used to work in retail." "I'd rather have flexible hours."</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal setting:</strong> "I used to skip breakfast, but now I eat healthy." "I'd rather save money than eat out."</li>
                </ul>

                <div style="background: rgba(122, 143, 124, 0.15); border-left: 4px solid #7ba884; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    <h3 style="color: #7ba884; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">🗣️ When You'll Use This Grammar</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>In class:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
                        <li>Describing work problems and solutions ("I used to have scheduling conflicts, but now...")</li>
                        <li>Talking about job history changes ("I used to work nights" "I'd rather have day shifts")</li>
                        <li>Practicing "used to / be used to / get used to" structures</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin: 1rem 0 0.5rem 0;"><strong>You'll also use this when:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">
                        <li><strong> Describing your wellness journey and habit changes ("I used to eat fast food, but now I cook at home")</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #3a3a3a;">🔄 These structures show growth and change - perfect for interviews and goal-setting!</p>

                <h3>What Is "Would Rather"?</h3>
                <p><strong>Would rather</strong> = I prefer (one thing over another). This is about what you WANT, not what you did in the past.</p>

                <div style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: rgba(244, 211, 94, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5rem;">
                    <h4>Formula:</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: bold; color: #d4a843;">Subject + would rather + base verb</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">(Contraction: I'd rather, She'd rather, etc.)</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Examples:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I <strong>would rather walk</strong> than drive. (= I prefer walking)</li>
                        <li>She <strong>'d rather work</strong> from home. (= She prefers working from home)</li>
                        <li>We <strong>'d rather eat</strong> healthy food. (= We prefer healthy food)</li>
                        <li>He <strong>'d rather not smoke</strong>. (= He prefers not to smoke)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Comparing Two Options</h3>
                <p>Use <strong>would rather... than...</strong> to compare preferences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'd rather <strong>cook at home</strong> than <strong>eat out</strong>.</li>

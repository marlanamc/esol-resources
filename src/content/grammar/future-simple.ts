    How to use this data:
    - If many students miss questions with skillTag "form-will-base-verb" or "form-negative-wont-base-verb",
      review the basic form: will/won't + base verb, and correct errors like "will to call" or "won't comes".
    - If scores are low on "form-question-will-subject-verb", practice question order (Will + subject + base verb)
      with speaking drills and substitution exercises.
    - If students struggle with "meaning-spontaneous-decision" or "meaning-trigger-language-spontaneous", use trigger cards
      (Oh!, Wait!, I forgot!, Don't worry!) and force immediate I will / I'll reactions.
    - If students struggle with "meaning-promise" and "contrast-promise-vs-plan", contrast will with going to
      and Present Continuous using real classroom examples (decisions made now vs plans made before class).
    - Weak performance on "contrast-will-going-to-plan" or "contrast-will-present-continuous-appointment"
      suggests you should revisit the section on will vs going to vs Present Continuous for future.
    - If "meaning-prediction-general-markers" or "meaning-prediction-based-evidence-going-to" is low, highlight the difference
      between no-evidence predictions (I think..., probably..., will) and evidence-based predictions (look..., going to).
    - If "pronunciation-wont-not-willnt" is weak, drill contractions in rhythm lines: "I'll call you later," "It'll be fine," "We'll see."
    - If "meaning-refusal-wont" is weak, show more examples of won't for refusal/failure ("The car won't start").

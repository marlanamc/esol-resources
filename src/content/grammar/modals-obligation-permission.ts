At work, the way you ask for permission or talk about obligations can make or break relationships. Modals are your secret weapon for sounding professional and polite.</p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Understanding modals helps you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Navigate workplace expectations</strong> - Know what's required vs. recommended</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask politely for what you need</strong> - Permission, time off, help, clarification</li>
                    <li><strong>Sound professional</strong> - Choose the right level of formality</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand your boss</strong> - Decode whether something is mandatory or optional</li>
                    <li><strong>Advocate for yourself</strong> - Request changes without sounding demanding</li>
                </ul>

                        <li>Having workplace conversations ("Could I ask you a question?" "May I leave early?")</li>
                        <li>Understanding workplace rules ("You must clock in" vs "You should arrive early")</li>
                        <li>Practicing polite requests in speaking games</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #3a3a3a;">💼 Remember: The way you ask for something at work can be just as important as what you're asking for!</p>

                    <p>Use when YOU feel it's necessary, or when stating official rules:</p>

                    <li>Can you...? (casual)</li>

                    <li>Would you...? (more polite)</li>

                <h3>Key Grammar Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Subject + modal + base verb (no -s, no -ing!)</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative:</strong> modal + not → can't, shouldn't, mustn't, don't have to</li>
                    <li><strong>Questions:</strong> Modal + subject + base verb? → Can I...? Should we...?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ "She cans come" → ✅ "She can come" (no -s on modals)</li>
                    <li>❌ "I must to work" → ✅ "I must work" OR "I have to work" (no 'to' after must)</li>
                    <li>❌ "You don't must" → ✅ "You must not" OR "You don't have to" (correct negative forms)</li>
                    <li>❌ "Could you helping me?" → ✅ "Could you help me?" (base verb after modal)</li>
                </ul>

  TEACHER DIAGNOSTIC NOTES – Modals: Obligation, Permission, Politeness Mini Quiz

  This mini quiz checks whether students can:
  - Understand the meaning difference between MUST, HAVE TO, SHOULD, CAN, MAY, COULD, and DO NOT HAVE TO.
  - Distinguish:
    • obligation vs advice vs permission vs not necessary vs forbidden.
    • workplace expectations vs strict rules.
  - Use correct grammar patterns:
    • Subject + modal + base verb (no -s, no -ing, no 'to' after must/can).
    • Correct question word order: modal + subject + base verb.
  - Choose appropriate politeness level when speaking to coworkers, supervisors, and HR.

  Skill tags:

  Meaning: obligation, advice, not necessary, rules
  - meaning-obligation-must
  - meaning-obligation-must-rule
  - meaning-obligation-have-to-external
  - meaning-advice-should
  - meaning-should-workplace-expectation
  - meaning-not-necessary-dont-have-to
  - contrast-dont-have-to-vs-must-not

  Permission and politeness
  - permission-can-casual-coworker
  - permission-could-polite-manager
  - permission-may-formal-hr
  - form-modal-question-word-order
  - politeness-request-could-boss
  - politeness-ladder-indirect-request

  Form: modal + base verb
  - form-modal-plus-base-verb
  - form-must-plus-base-verb

  Rules and workplace context
  - meaning-rule-must-id-badge

  How to read the diagnostics:
  - If obligation vs advice tags are weak (meaning-obligation-must, meaning-obligation-have-to-external, meaning-advice-should, meaning-should-workplace-expectation) →
    Rebuild the chart from the guide:
    • MUST / HAVE TO = required (rules, schedules, laws).
    • SHOULD = advice/expectation (good idea, but grammar softer).
    Use real example sentences from your students' jobs and have them sort them into REQUIRED vs RECOMMENDED.

  - If not necessary vs forbidden tags are weak (meaning-not-necessary-dont-have-to, contrast-dont-have-to-vs-must-not) →
    Make a three-column chart:
    • REQUIRED: must, have to.
    • NOT NECESSARY: do not have to.
    • FORBIDDEN: must not.
    Ask students to move sentence cards into the correct column, then explain in their own words.

  - If form tags are weak (form-modal-plus-base-verb, form-must-plus-base-verb, form-modal-question-word-order) →
    Go back to the pattern:
    • Statement: Subject + modal + base verb → She can work. I must leave.
    • Question: Modal + subject + base verb → Can I leave? May I ask?
    Do quick error-correction drills:
    • She cans work → She can work.
    • I must to leave → I must leave.
    • I may speak with you? → May I speak with you?

  - If permission/politeness tags are weak (permission-can-casual-coworker, permission-could-polite-manager, permission-may-formal-hr, politeness-request-could-boss, politeness-ladder-indirect-request) →
    Re-teach the politeness ladder:
    • Can you...? (casual)
    • Could you...? (standard polite)
    • May I...? (formal)
    • I was wondering if you could... (very polite, indirect)
    Use role-plays with different power levels:
    • Coworker to coworker → Can you / Could you.
    • Employee to supervisor → Could you / Would it be possible.
    • Employee to HR or director → May I / I was wondering if I could.

  - If rules and workplace context tags are weak (meaning-obligation-must-rule, meaning-rule-must-id-badge) →
    Collect real workplace signs and policies:
    • Employees must...
    • Visitors must...
    • You must wear...
    Have students rewrite them in spoken language with HAVE TO, and also rewrite spoken sentences back into formal sign language with MUST.

  Suggested use:
  - Use this mini quiz after students complete the sections on:
    • Must vs Have to.
    • Can/May/Could for permission.
    • Should for advice and workplace expectations.
    • Politeness ladder for requests at work.
  - At the class level:
    • If meaning tags are red → spend more time on charts, scenarios, and sentence sorting (Required vs Recommended vs Optional vs Forbidden).
    • If form tags are red → do short, high-repetition drills focusing on modal + base verb and question word order.
    • If politeness tags are red → prioritize speaking activities and role-plays where students practice asking for help, time off, and clarification in different levels of formality.

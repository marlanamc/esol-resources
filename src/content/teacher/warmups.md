# Speaking Warmups Teaching Guide

**For:** ESOL Level 3 Adult Learners (NRS Level 3-4)
**Class:** Tuesdays & Thursdays, 6:00-8:15pm
**Duration:** 5-15 minutes per warmup
**Purpose:** Pre-teach grammar structures through authentic speaking practice

---

## 1. Philosophy: Why Speaking-First Works

### The Problem with Traditional Grammar Instruction
Traditional ESOL classes often teach grammar rules first, then ask students to speak. This creates anxiety and limits fluency because students are trying to apply abstract rules in real-time conversation.

### The Speaking-First Approach
**Warmups introduce grammar structures through speaking BEFORE formal instruction.** Students use the grammar naturally in conversation, notice the patterns, and THEN learn the rules. This mirrors how we acquire our first language.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Lower anxiety:** Students speak before they know they're being tested on grammar
- **Authentic need:** Grammar emerges from real communication needs
- **Better retention:** Students remember language they've used, not just studied
- **Student noticing:** "Wait, we all keep saying 'had been'—what is that?" → Perfect setup for explicit instruction

## 2. CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Warmup-Grammar-Theme Alignment

### The Golden Rule
**Every warmup must use the grammar structure being taught that week in the context of the weekly theme.**

This creates a powerful learning sequence:
1. **Monday/Tuesday morning:** Students encounter the grammar in the warmup (implicit)
2. **Tuesday/Thursday class:** Explicit grammar instruction explains what they already used
3. **Throughout the week:** Students continue practicing in authentic contexts

### Example: Week 21 (Housing Unit + Past Perfect)

**Theme:** Housing/Budgeting
**Grammar:** Past Perfect (taught Tuesday 2/10)
**Warmup (2/10):** "Budgeting, Bills, Credit & Debt"

**Warmup prompts use Past Perfect in housing/money context:**
- "What bills had you paid by the middle of last month?"
- "By the time you checked your account, what had already happened?"
- "Before you called the landlord, what had you tried?"

**Why this works:**
- Students use "had paid," "had already happened," "had tried" naturally
- They notice the pattern: "had + past verb"
- Teacher bridges to grammar lesson: *"Did you notice we were all using 'had' before our verbs? That's past perfect!"*

### Example: Week 33 (Wellness Unit + Future Conditional)

**Theme:** Home Remedies
**Grammar:** Future Conditional (If + present, will + verb)
**Warmup (5/19):** "Home Remedies & Natural Solutions"

**Warmup prompts:**
- "If you have a cold, what will you do? What home remedy will you try?"
- "If tea with honey doesn't work, what will you try next?"

**Bridge to grammar:**
- Students naturally use conditionals to talk about health choices
- Teacher highlights the pattern during explicit instruction

---

## 3. Daily Implementation (5-15 Minutes)

### Basic Structure

**1. Introduction (1-2 min):**
- Display warmup title and key phrases on board/screen
- Read 1-2 example sentences aloud
- Check comprehension: "What does this phrase mean?"

**2. Individual Think Time (1 min):**
- Students choose 2-3 prompts (minimum required)
- Jot down 2-3 key words (not full sentences)
- This reduces anxiety and gives processing time

**3. Partner/Small Group Practice (5-10 min):**
- Pairs or groups of 3-4
- Each person speaks for 1-2 minutes per prompt
- Partners ask 1 follow-up question
- Rotate: Everyone should speak at least twice

**4. Whole Class Sharing (2-3 min - optional):**
- 2-3 volunteers share one interesting thing they heard
- Teacher highlights good use of target grammar (without correcting)
- Bridge to the day's lesson if applicable

**5. Reflection Submission (2 min):**
- Students write brief reflection (30-40 characters minimum)
- Submit via Class Companion for 6 points

### Time Management for 2-Class-Per-Week Schedule

**Tuesday (Grammar Introduction Day):**
- **10-15 minutes:** Longer warmup to establish the pattern
- Students notice and use the grammar before you teach it
- Teacher listens for examples to use during instruction

**Thursday (Grammar Practice/Review Day):**
- **5-8 minutes:** Shorter warmup for fluency practice
- Students apply what they learned Tuesday
- Focus on speed and confidence

## 4. Scaffolding Techniques

### For Beginner-Level Students

**Sentence Frames:**
- Write sentence starters on the board
- Example: "I have been ___-ing for ___."
- Students fill in the blanks orally

**Visual Supports:**
- Show images related to the theme (housing, work, health)
- Students describe what they see using target grammar

**Think-Pair-Share:**
- Think (individual): 30 seconds
- Pair: Share with partner
- Share: Volunteer to class

### For Intermediate Students

**Question Prompts:**
- Provide guiding questions but minimal sentence frames
- Encourage 2-3 sentence responses
- Example: "How long have you been working at your job? What have you been doing there?"

**Choice Boards:**
- Students choose from beginner/intermediate/advanced prompts
- Self-select based on confidence level

### For Advanced Students

**Extended Discourse:**
- Respond to prompts with 5-7 sentences
- Include examples, details, and elaboration
- Compare/contrast two ideas

**Grammar Mixing:**
- Combine multiple grammar structures
- Example: "Use past perfect AND Type 1 conditional in your answer"

### Mixed-Level Grouping Strategies

**Homogeneous Groups (same level):**
- Use when introducing new grammar
- Allows targeted scaffolding

**Heterogeneous Groups (mixed levels):**
- Use for review warmups
- Advanced students model for beginners
- Beginners ask clarifying questions

## 5. Technology Integration

### Using Phones for Self-Assessment

**Voice Memo Practice:**
1. Students record themselves answering one prompt
2. Listen back and count how many times they used target grammar
3. Re-record to improve

**Benefits:**
- Students hear their own progress
- Less pressure than live speaking
- Can practice at home

### Class Companion Submission

**After warmup:**
- Students submit written reflection (30-40 characters)
- Earn 6 points per completed warmup
- Teacher can see who practiced and what they found challenging

**Sample Reflection Prompts:**
- "What grammar structure did you practice? What was challenging?"
- "Which prompt was hardest? Why?"
- "How comfortable are you using [grammar]?"

### Digital Warmup Display

**Project on screen:**
- Title, key phrases, prompts
- Students can see while speaking
- Reference during partner work

## 6. Connection to Grammar Lessons

### The Bridge: Making Implicit Knowledge Explicit

**Step 1: Notice (during warmup)**
- Teacher listens for examples of target grammar
- Note 2-3 good student sentences

**Step 2: Highlight (transition to grammar lesson)**
- Teacher says: "I heard many of you using a pattern: 'I had been working...', 'She had been trying...'"
- Write student examples on board

**Step 3: Analyze (explicit instruction)**
- "This is called Past Perfect Continuous. Let's look at the pattern."
- Students realize they already used it successfully

**Step 4: Practice (grammar exercises)**
- More controlled practice with the structure
- Students feel confident because they've already used it

### Sample Bridge Language

**For Type 0 Conditionals (Week 19):**
- *"Did you notice? When we talk about banking facts, we use 'if' + present tense. 'If you pay late, you GET a fee.' This is Type 0 conditional—let's learn when to use it."*

**For Present Perfect Continuous (Week 24):**
- *"I heard you saying 'I have been looking,' 'I have been working.' You're using Present Perfect Continuous! This tense shows an action that started in the past and is still happening. Let's explore when we use it."*

**For Passive Voice (Week 30):**
- *"You said 'I was born,' 'The building was built.' These are all passive voice—when we focus on the action, not who did it. Let's learn how to form it."*

## 7. Assessment & Progress Tracking

### Formative Assessment Through Warmups

**What to Listen For:**
- ✅ Are students using the target grammar?
- ✅ Are they self-correcting?
- ✅ Do they need more scaffolding?

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't interrupt to correct during warmup
- ❌ Don't grade warmups for accuracy
- ❌ Don't call on students who aren't volunteering

**Using Reflections as Data:**
- If 70%+ students say a grammar point is "very difficult," plan extra practice
- If students mention the same challenge, address it in Thursday's lesson
- Look for growth over time in reflection sophistication

### Tracking Individual Progress

**Class Companion Dashboard:**
- See which students are completing warmups (6 points each)
- Read reflections to identify struggling students
- Check streak data: Are students practicing consistently?

**Informal Notes:**
- Keep a class list during warmups
- Note which students:
  - Use target grammar correctly
  - Avoid speaking
  - Need extra support

## 8. Differentiation Strategies

### Prompt Selection

**Beginner Prompts:**
- Shorter, simpler questions
- One clear grammar focus
- Example: "What do you enjoy doing at work?"

**Intermediate Prompts:**
- 2-3 part questions
- Mix grammar structures
- Example: "What do you enjoy doing (gerund) vs. What do you want to do (infinitive)?"

**Advanced Prompts:**
- Open-ended, complex tasks
- Multiple grammar structures required
- Example: "Compare past simple (what happened) vs. present perfect continuous (what has been happening)"

### Allowing Student Choice

**Freedom to Choose:**
- Students must do minimum 2-3 prompts
- They can choose from beginner/intermediate/advanced
- Self-selection empowers students

**Encouraging Challenge:**
- "Try one prompt that feels a little hard today"
- Celebrate attempts, not perfection

### Extension Activities for Fast Finishers

**If students finish early:**
- Add a 4th or 5th prompt
- Write down 3 sentences using the target grammar
- Create their own prompt for a partner

## 9. Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "Students don't want to speak"

**Solutions:**
- Start with written responses, then share verbally
- Use think-pair-share (less pressure than whole class)
- Allow students to pass on sharing publicly
- Build trust: warmups are practice, not performance

### Challenge: "Mixed-level groups—beginners can't keep up"

**Solutions:**
- Group by level for new grammar introductions
- Mix levels for review warmups
- Provide sentence frames for beginners
- Let advanced students model first

### Challenge: "We don't have enough time"

**Solutions:**
- Shorten to 5 minutes on busy days
- Choose 3 prompts instead of 6
- Skip whole-class sharing
- Do warmup as students arrive (first 10 minutes of class)

### Challenge: "Students are making lots of errors"

**Solutions:**
- Remember: Warmups are for FLUENCY, not accuracy
- Errors are normal when using new grammar
- Note common errors for explicit instruction later
- Praise attempts: "I love that you tried using past perfect!"

### Challenge: "Students use their native language"

**Solutions:**
- Allow brief native language for clarification
- Encourage: "Try in English first, then translate if needed"
- Partner students strategically (avoid same L1 pairs if possible)
- Model: Rephrase their native language in English

### Challenge: "Silent periods—no one is talking"

**Solutions:**
- Wait time: Give 30 seconds of silence for thinking
- Model first: Teacher answers one prompt
- Start with partners before whole group
- Use sentence frames to lower the barrier

## 12. FAQ

**Q: What if students haven't learned the grammar yet and make mistakes?**
A: That's the point! Warmups introduce grammar through speaking. Errors are expected and valuable. You'll address them during explicit instruction.

**Q: Can I use the same warmup twice?**
A: Yes! Reusable warmups (no dates) can be used anytime after the grammar is taught. Dated warmups align with specific lessons.

**Q: What if my class is running late?**
A: Shorten warmup to 5 minutes: partners only, no whole-class sharing. Don't skip entirely—speaking practice is crucial.

**Q: How do I handle students who don't submit reflections?**
A: Remind them it's worth 6 points and helps you plan better lessons. Some students need encouragement to see the value.

**Q: Should I use all 6-7 prompts?**
A: No! Students choose 2-3 prompts minimum (you set the requirement). This gives choice and reduces pressure.

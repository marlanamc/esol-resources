## Notes on NRS Adult ESL Level 3–4 (Low/High Intermediate)

- **Instructional sweet spot:** real‑life tasks + clear language frames (students can do complex tasks when the language is scaffolded).
- **Pacing for 2 days/week:** fewer new targets, more recycling; plan for **spiral review every Thursday** and short weekly “retrieval” routines (2–5 minutes).
- **What to prioritize:** question formation + follow‑ups, modals for requests/advice, high‑frequency tense control (past, present perfect, continuous), and workplace/health system language.
- **Differentiation (easy):** give a “Level 3” and “Level 4” option for output (3 sentences vs 6; paragraph frame vs open paragraph; role‑play with cards vs without).
- **Assessment alignment:** monthly quizzes work best when they include **1 short reading**, **1 short writing**, and **1 mini speaking task** (role‑play or 60‑second talk) to hit interpretive/productive/interactive skills.

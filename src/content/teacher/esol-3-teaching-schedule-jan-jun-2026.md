## Homework strategy (Zero checking time!)

**Weekly homework** (assigned Tuesday, due next Tuesday):

1. **Required**: Complete grammar guide on Class Companion (20-30 min)
   - Interactive exercises + mini-quiz
   - Auto-graded (no teacher checking needed!)
   - Students earn points/achievements
   - Dashboard shows completion

2. **Optional bonus**: Verb quiz (5 min, online, auto-graded)
   - Extra points on Class Companion

**Why this works**:
- No more 30 minutes of class time checking homework
- No more copying (individual logins!)
- Clear connection to what they're learning
- Immediate feedback through mini-quizzes

**Stand Out 3 workbook**: Use IN CLASS (last 15 min Thursday), not as homework

**Quick homework check** (2 min Tuesday): "Tell your partner one thing you practiced on Class Companion this week"

## Notes on NRS Adult ESL Level 3–4 (Low/High Intermediate)

- **Instructional sweet spot:** real‑life tasks + clear language frames (students can do complex tasks when the language is scaffolded).
- **Pacing for 2 days/week:** fewer new targets, more recycling; plan for **spiral review every Thursday** and short weekly “retrieval” routines (2–5 minutes).
- **What to prioritize:** question formation + follow‑ups, modals for requests/advice, high‑frequency tense control (past, present perfect, continuous), and workplace/health system language.
- **Differentiation (easy):** give a “Level 3” and “Level 4” option for output (3 sentences vs 6; paragraph frame vs open paragraph; role‑play with cards vs without).
- **Assessment alignment:** monthly quizzes work best when they include **1 short reading**, **1 short writing**, and **1 mini speaking task** (role‑play or 60‑second talk) to hit interpretive/productive/interactive skills.

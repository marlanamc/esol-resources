# Legacy Grammar Guides (Unit-Focused)

This directory contains the original unit-focused grammar guides that were replaced with more generic, universally applicable versions.

## Why These Were Archived

These guides were created with good intentions to align grammar teaching with specific units (Jobs, Health), but they had critical problems:

1. **Too narrow in scope**: Every example was unit-specific (e.g., "If you clock in after 9:05 AM..." for conditionals)
2. **Lost universal applicability**: Students couldn't see how grammar works across ALL life situations
3. **Dense and less engaging**: Material felt like "workplace English course" rather than "grammar course"
4. **Limited vocabulary exposure**: Students only encountered job/health vocabulary, missing broader language exposure

## The Solution: Grammar-First Approach

The new guides follow the successful **Past Perfect model**:
- **Grammar concept comes FIRST** with engaging metaphors and universal examples
- Examples span multiple life domains (cooking, weather, travel, relationships, shopping, etc.)
- **Optional supplementary context sections** (like Career Planning, Professional Settings) come AT THE END
- Students learn grammar that works everywhere, not just narrow contexts

## Files in This Directory

- `conditionals-zero-first-jobs.ts` - Zero & First Conditionals with workplace focus

## Replaced By

These files were replaced with generic versions:
- `conditionals-zero-first.ts` - Generic zero/first conditionals (no supplement needed - too universal)
- `conditionals-second-third.ts` - Generic with career advice supplement (Section 9)
- `gerunds-infinitives.ts` - Pattern-based generic guide (no supplement needed)
- `future-perfect.ts` - Generic with career planning supplement (Section 9)
- `past-perfect.ts` - Generic with housing supplement (Section 8) - already existed and worked great!

## Can These Be Used?

These guides are still functional and contain good content, but they're not recommended for general grammar instruction. They work best as:
- Supplementary materials for specific unit contexts
- Additional practice after students have learned the generic grammar
- Examples of how NOT to structure primary grammar guides (valuable for future content creation!)

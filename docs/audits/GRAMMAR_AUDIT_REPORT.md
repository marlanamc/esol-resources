**Severity:** HIGH

Future Perfect appears in **11 activities** but is **NOT taught** anywhere in the Jan-Jun 2026 curriculum:

| Activity File | Date | Line(s) | Usage |
|--------------|------|---------|-------|
| `healthcare-basics.ts` | (Reusable) | 13, 44 | "By next week, I will have finished..." |
| `transportation-basics.ts` | (Reusable) | 13, 44 | "By next year, I will have learned to drive." |
| `wellness-basics.ts` | (Reusable) | 51 | "By December, I will have established..." |
| `perfect-continuous.ts` | (Reusable) | 12, 45, 51 | "By next year, I will have been teaching..." |
| `passive-voice.ts` | (Reusable) | 51-52 | "The school will have been built" (Future Perfect Passive) |
| `summer-next-steps-goals-2026-06-11.ts` | 6/11/26 | 11, 32-33 | "By September, I will have applied..." |

**RECOMMENDATION:** Either:

### 🟡 Issue #2: Past Perfect Used Before It's Taught

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**First Teaching Date:** 2/10/26

| Activity File | Scheduled Date | Grammar Used | Action Needed |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| `gerunds-infinitives.ts` | 2/12/26 | Past Perfect in prompt 6 | ⚠️ Borderline - only 2 days after teaching |
| `healthcare-basics.ts` | (Reusable) | Past Perfect in prompt 6 (line 37-38) | ✅ OK if used after 2/10 |
| `transportation-basics.ts` | (Reusable) | Past Perfect in prompt 6 (line 37-38) | ✅ OK if used after 2/10 |
| `wellness-basics.ts` | (Reusable) | Past Perfect in prompt 7 (line 44-45) | ✅ OK if used after 2/10 |
| `banking-basics.ts` | (Reusable) | "had to return" (line 37) | ✅ OK - This is "had to" (modal), not past perfect |

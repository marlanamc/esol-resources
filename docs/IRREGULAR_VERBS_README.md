---

## 🌟 Highlights

### Why This Works
- **Pattern-based learning** is more effective than memorization
- **5 exercise types** prevent boredom
- **80% threshold** ensures mastery before progression
- **Gamification** maintains motivation
- **Mobile-first** accessible to all students
- **Sequential unlock** builds confidence gradually

### Student Experience
- 🎮 Engaging game format (not "just an exercise")
- 📈 Clear progress visualization
- 🎯 Achievable goals (80% to unlock, not 100%)
- 🏆 Rewards for completion (points, unlocks, leaderboard)
- 📚 Learning support (pattern hints, examples)

### Teacher Experience
- 📊 Easy assignment (one click)
- 📈 Automatic progress tracking
- 🎯 Clear mastery indicators (80% achieved)
- 💾 Persistent data (saved to database)
- 📋 No grading needed (self-grading exercises)

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### By Design (Not Bugs)
1. **Preferences UI not in settings yet** - Preference is stored but UI toggle planned
2. **No spaced repetition** - Groups reset on reload (can add later)
3. **No custom verb groups** - Fixed 10 groups (teacher customization is future feature)

### Acceptable Trade-offs
1. **Speed matching timer is 15 seconds** - Optimal for engagement without frustration
2. **Only 10 exercises per group** - Sweet spot for completion time
3. **No audio** - Future enhancement (TTS can be added)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- [ ] Preferences UI in settings dashboard
- [ ] Spaced repetition algorithm
- [ ] Audio pronunciation (TTS)
- [ ] Achievement badges

### Phase 3+ (Possible)
- [ ] Teacher custom verb groups
- [ ] Multilingual translations
- [ ] Progress export (PDF)
- [ ] Collaborative learning modes

# Grammar Activities TODO

## Gerunds & Infinitives - Updates Needed

### Current State
We have 3 lessons:
1. `infinitives-vs-gerunds.ts` - Main comparison guide (614 lines)
2. `verbs-plus-gerunds.ts` - Verb + Gerund patterns
3. `gerunds-prepositions.ts` - Preposition + Gerund patterns

### Missing Patterns (Based on Teaching Chart)
Need to add these patterns to existing lessons:

#### 1. Subject = Gerund (MISSING)
**Pattern**: Gerund as subject of sentence
- Examples: "Swimming is fun!", "Reading is relaxing", "Cooking takes time"
- **Add to**: `infinitives-vs-gerunds.ts` as a new section (Step 4 or 5)
- **Include**:
  - Explanation: Gerunds can act as nouns/subjects
  - Common uses: hobbies, activities, general statements
  - Exercises: Identify gerund subjects, create sentences

#### 2. Adjective + Infinitive (MISSING)
**Pattern**: It's + adjective + infinitive
- Examples: "It's nice to meet you", "It's important to arrive on time", "It's easy to learn"
- **Add to**: `infinitives-vs-gerunds.ts` as a new section
- **Include**:
  - Formula: It's + [adjective] + to + [verb]
  - Common adjectives: nice, important, easy, hard, good, difficult, necessary
  - Speaking practice: Giving opinions, making small talk

#### 3. Noun + Infinitive (MISSING)
**Pattern**: Object pronoun + infinitive
- Examples: "You asked me to call you", "She wants us to help", "I need you to listen"
- **Add to**: `infinitives-vs-gerunds.ts` as a new section
- **Include**:
  - Formula: Verb + [object] + to + [verb]
  - Common verbs: ask, want, need, tell, expect, would like
  - Speaking practice: Making requests, giving instructions

### Update Plan for Existing Files

#### `infinitives-vs-gerunds.ts` - COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE
**Current structure**: Introduction → Definitions → Verb + Infinitive → Verb + Gerund → Verbs that take both

**New structure (add 3 new sections)**:
1. Introduction (keep as is)
2. Definitions (keep as is)
3. **NEW: Pattern 1 - Subject = Gerund** (Step 1)
   - "Swimming is fun!" "Cooking takes time"
4. **Verb + Gerund** (Step 2 - already exists, just renumber)
   - "I enjoy cooking" "She stopped smoking"
5. **Preposition + Gerund** (Step 3 - reference to gerunds-prepositions.ts)
   - "I'm good at cooking" "Thank you for helping"
6. **NEW: Pattern 4 - Adjective + Infinitive** (Step 4)
   - "It's nice to meet you" "It's important to be on time"
7. **NEW: Pattern 5 - Noun + Infinitive** (Step 5)

8. **Verb + Infinitive** (Step 6 - already exists, renumber)
   - "I want to work here" "She decided to apply"
9. Verbs that take both (Step 7 - already exists, renumber)
10. Mini-quiz (update to include all 6 patterns)

#### `verbs-plus-gerunds.ts` - MINOR UPDATE
**Current focus**: Health/wellness habits (Week 19)
**Update needed**:
- Add cross-reference to main guide for other gerund patterns
- Add note: "This is Pattern 3: Verb + Gerund from the 6 patterns"
- Keep wellness/habit focus (this is specialized for Week 19)

#### `gerunds-prepositions.ts` - MINOR UPDATE
**Current focus**: Job applications/professional communication
**Update needed**:

## Parts of Speech - Updates Needed

### Current State
We have `parts-of-speech.ts` (801 lines) that covers **4 main types**:
1. ✅ Nouns (people, places, things, ideas)
2. ✅ Verbs (actions, states)
3. ✅ Adjectives (describe nouns)
4. ✅ Adverbs (describe verbs - how, how often)

### Missing Parts (Based on Comprehensive Chart)
Need to add 4 more parts of speech:

#### 1. Pronouns (MISSING - CRITICAL)
**What**: Words that take a noun's place
**Types needed**:
- Subject pronouns: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
- Object pronouns: me, you, him, her, it, us, them
- Possessive adjectives: my, your, his, her, its, our, their

**Examples from chart**:
- "People like **him**." (object pronoun)
- "**She** went to Hawaii." (subject pronoun)
- "The girl ate an apple." → "**She** ate **it**."

**Why critical**: Students use pronouns CONSTANTLY but make mistakes with he/him, she/her, they/them

**Add as**: New section (Step 5) after Adverbs
- Explain: Subject vs Object vs Possessive
- Key rule: Subjects come BEFORE verb, Objects come AFTER verb
- Common mistakes: "Me and my friend" (should be "My friend and I")
- Exercises: Replace nouns with pronouns, choose correct pronoun

#### 2. Articles (MISSING - CRITICAL)
**What**: Give information about nouns (how many, general or specific)
**Types**: a, an, the

**Examples from chart**:
- "I have **a** puppy." (one puppy, not specific)
- "She is eating **an** orange." (one orange, not specific)
- "**The** books are over there." (specific books)

**Why critical**: Articles are EVERYWHERE and students often omit them or use wrong ones

**Add as**: New section (Step 6) after Pronouns
- Explain: "a/an" = one, not specific | "the" = specific
- Rule: "a" before consonant sounds, "an" before vowel sounds
- When to use each: First mention = a/an, Second mention = the
- Exercises: Choose a/an/the, identify when to use articles

#### 3. Prepositions (MISSING - IMPORTANT)
**What**: Give information about nouns (direction, time, location, etc.)
**Common ones**: in, on, at, to, from, between, under, for, with

**Examples from chart**:
- "He is walking **to** school."
- "My birthday is **in** July."
- "I work **at** home."

**Why important**: Prepositions connect ideas and show relationships

**Add as**: New section (Step 7) after Articles
- Explain: Come BEFORE nouns to show relationship
- Categories: Time (in, on, at), Location (in, on, at, under, between), Direction (to, from, toward)
- Exercises: Choose correct preposition, identify prepositions in sentences

#### 4. Conjunctions (MISSING - IMPORTANT)
**What**: Join 2 sentences or 2 similar parts of speech
**Types**: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so ("FANBOYS")

**Examples from chart**:
- "You can call **or** text me."
- "Our cat is cute **and** lazy."
- "I try hard, **but** keep failing."

**Why important**: Conjunctions make sentences flow better and connect ideas

**Add as**: New section (Step 8) after Prepositions
- Explain: Come BETWEEN 2 nouns, 2 verbs, 2 adjectives, 2 adverbs, or 2 sentences
- Memory trick: "FANBOYS" = For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So
- Comma rule: Use comma before conjunction when joining 2 complete sentences
- Exercises: Choose correct conjunction, combine sentences

### Update Plan for `parts-of-speech.ts`

**Current structure** (4 sections):
1. Introduction
2. Step 1: Nouns
3. Step 2: Verbs
4. Step 3: Adjectives
5. Step 4: Adverbs
6. Mini-quiz (4 main parts only)

**New structure** (8 sections - COMPREHENSIVE):
1. Introduction (update to mention all 8 parts)
2. Step 1: Nouns (keep as is)
3. Step 2: Verbs (keep as is)
4. Step 3: Adjectives (keep as is)
5. Step 4: Adverbs (keep as is)
6. **Step 5: Pronouns** (NEW - CRITICAL)
7. **Step 6: Articles** (NEW - CRITICAL)
8. **Step 7: Prepositions** (NEW - IMPORTANT)
9. **Step 8: Conjunctions** (NEW - IMPORTANT)
10. Mini-quiz (update to include all 8 parts)

### Priority Level
**HIGH PRIORITY** - This is Week 16 (first week)! Students need ALL 8 parts of speech from the beginning.

**Pronouns and Articles** are most critical:
- Students use them constantly
- Common error patterns that need correction early
- Foundation for understanding all future grammar

**Prepositions and Conjunctions** are important:
- Needed for complex sentences
- Help with fluency and natural speech
- Build on the foundation of other parts

## Conditionals - New Activities Needed

### Current State
Based on your chart, we need activities for:
1. Zero Conditional (general truths/scientific facts)
2. First Conditional (real/possible future)
3. Second Conditional (unreal/hypothetical present/future)
4. Third Conditional (unreal past situations)

### Activities to Create

#### 1. `future-conditional.ts` (already exists)
**Check if it covers**: First conditional (real/possible future)
- If + present simple → future simple
- "If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home"
- "You will succeed if you work hard"

**If missing**: Add zero conditional section
- If + present simple → present simple
- "If you heat water to 100°C, it boils"
- "The sidewalk gets wet if it rains"

#### 2. Create: `conditionals-zero-first.ts` (NEW)
**Focus**: Zero and First conditionals (real situations)
**When used**: Week 18 (Wellness - Future goals)

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Real vs general truth conditionals
- Section 1: Zero Conditional (scientific facts, general truths, habits)
  - Formula: If + present simple → present simple
  - Examples: Health facts, daily routines
  - Exercises: Match causes to effects
- Section 2: First Conditional (real future possibilities)
  - Formula: If + present simple → will + base verb
  - Examples: Wellness goals, plans, predictions
  - Exercises: Complete sentences, create goal statements
- Speaking practice: "If I exercise 3 times a week, I will feel better"
- Mini-quiz: Distinguish zero vs first conditional

#### 3. Create: `conditionals-second.ts` (NEW)
**Focus**: Second conditional (unreal/hypothetical present/future)
**When used**: Week 18 or 19 (Hypothetical wellness scenarios)

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Hypothetical situations
- Formula: If + past simple → would + base verb
- Examples:
  - "If I won the lottery, I would travel the world"
  - "She would cook more if she had the time"
  - "If I had more energy, I would exercise daily"
- Contrast with first conditional: "If I save money, I will travel" (realistic) vs "If I won the lottery, I would travel" (unlikely)
- Exercises: Rewrite first conditional → second conditional
- Speaking practice: Dream scenarios, advice giving
- Mini-quiz: Choose first vs second conditional

#### 4. Create: `conditionals-third.ts` (NEW) - OPTIONAL
**Focus**: Third conditional (unreal past - regrets, missed opportunities)
**When used**: Advanced review (Week 21-22?)

**Structure**:
- Introduction: Talking about past situations that didn't happen
- Formula: If + past perfect → would + present perfect
- Examples:
  - "If I had known about the party, I would have gone"
  - "They would have arrived earlier if they had taken the train"
- Common use: Expressing regret, explaining what went wrong
- Exercises: Identify third conditional, complete sentences
- Speaking practice: Year-in-review regrets/lessons learned
- Mini-quiz: All conditionals review

#### 5. Create: `conditionals-review.ts` (NEW)
**Focus**: All 4 conditional types comparison
**When used**: Week 21 (Year Review)

**Structure**:
- Quick reference chart (like the image you showed)
- Exercises: Identify conditional type
- Mixed practice: Choose correct conditional for situation
- Speaking practice: Tell coherent stories using multiple conditional types
- Comprehensive mini-quiz

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Gerunds & Infinitives (Week 8 - Feb 24)
1. Update `infinitives-vs-gerunds.ts` - Add 3 missing patterns
   - Subject = Gerund
   - Adjective + Infinitive
   - Noun + Infinitive
2. Add cross-references to `verbs-plus-gerunds.ts` and `gerunds-prepositions.ts`

### Phase 2: Conditionals - Basic (Week 18 - May 19)
1. Check/update `future-conditional.ts` (add zero conditional if missing)
2. Create `conditionals-zero-first.ts` (essential for wellness goals)

### Phase 3: Conditionals - Advanced (Week 19-21)
1. Create `conditionals-second.ts` (hypothetical scenarios)
2. Create `conditionals-review.ts` (all types comparison)

### Phase 4: Optional
1. Create `conditionals-third.ts` (if time permits, for advanced review)

---

## File Naming Conventions
- Keep existing: `infinitives-vs-gerunds.ts`, `verbs-plus-gerunds.ts`, `gerunds-prepositions.ts`
- New conditionals: `conditionals-zero-first.ts`, `conditionals-second.ts`, `conditionals-third.ts`, `conditionals-review.ts`

## Cross-References Strategy
Each specialized guide should reference the comprehensive guide:
- `verbs-plus-gerunds.ts` → "This is Pattern 3 from Infinitives vs Gerunds. See that guide for all 6 patterns."
- `gerunds-prepositions.ts` → "This is Pattern 2 from Infinitives vs Gerunds. See that guide for all 6 patterns."

---

## Notes
- All new sections need exercises (radio, select, text input)
- All guides need mini-quizzes (80% to pass)
- Speaking practice prompts should connect to weekly topics
- Use color-coded boxes: blue for infinitives, green for gerunds, orange for conditionals
- Memory tricks/mnemonics help students remember patterns

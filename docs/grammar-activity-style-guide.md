# Grammar Activity Style Guide

## Purpose
This guide documents the tone, language, and content approach for grammar activities in the ESOL Teacher Resources platform. These guidelines ensure all activities remain relatable, engaging, and accessible to our primary audience: adult English language learners working in restaurants, factories, and other service industries.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Relatable, Universal Examples**
- ✅ Use everyday scenarios everyone experiences: family, food, daily routines, entertainment, health, neighborhood life
- ✅ Reference contexts applicable to all workers: shifts, schedules, breaks, coworkers
- ❌ Avoid corporate/office-specific language: remote work, Zoom calls, client meetings, presentations, decks, reports
- ❌ Avoid tech industry jargon: deployments, QA, staging, onboarding, stand-ups

**Example Comparison:**
- ❌ "I was uploading the report at 11:58 PM."
- ✅ "I was sleeping at midnight when you called."

### 2. **Conversational, Warm Tone**
- Speak **TO** the learner, not **AT** them
- Use second person when appropriate: "Think about how you describe your daily life"
- Acknowledge the struggle and reality of learning: "Native speakers mess this up too—you're not alone"
- Add humor where natural (but never at the learner's expense)

**Example:**
> "Grammar rules are boring. But understanding when native speakers use Present Simple? That's the difference."

### 3. **Real-Life Language**
- Use contractions naturally: "I'll", "won't", "didn't", "it's"
- Include realistic filler language: "again", "too late", "always", "every single"
- Avoid overly formal or academic phrasing

**Example Comparison:**
- ❌ "The Wi-Fi connection terminated unexpectedly."
- ✅ "The Wi-Fi stopped working the moment you need it most."

### 4. **Each Activity Has Its Own Personality**
Give each tense a distinct voice to keep activities fresh and memorable:

| Tense | Personality | Voice Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Present Simple** | Relatable truth-teller | Self-aware, humorous, acknowledges universal frustrations |
| **Present Continuous** | Energetic observer | In-the-moment, vivid, captures life as it happens |
| **Past Simple** | Nostalgic storyteller | Narrative, sequential, reflective about what already happened |
| **Future Simple** | Hopeful optimist | Forward-looking, encouraging, focused on plans and promises |
| **Past Continuous** | Dramatic scene-setter | Cinematic, focuses on interrupted moments and background actions |
| **Future Continuous** | Planning coordinator | Organized, polite, thinks ahead about what will be happening |

## Content Guidelines

### Example Selection

#### ✅ **DO Use:**
- **Daily routines:** waking up, eating, sleeping, commuting
- **Food & cooking:** making dinner, ordering takeout, eating breakfast
- **Family & relationships:** calling mom, staying with sister, visiting family
- **Entertainment:** watching TV/movies, listening to music, playing games
- **Weather:** rain, cold, storms (universal experiences)
- **Transportation:** buses, walking, driving, catching rides
- **Home life:** cleaning, doing laundry, fixing things

- **Tech industry:** deploying code, testing features, onboarding, stand-ups
- **Office equipment:** printers, projectors, slide decks
- **Business processes:** reports, budgets, approvals, launches
- **Professional jargon:** QA, stakeholders, deliverables, bandwidth

### Writing Examples

**Present Simple - "Coffee costs too much"**
- Simple, relatable observation
- No explanation needed—everyone knows this pain
- Shows universal experience

**Present Continuous - "She is talking on the phone, and her kid is yelling in the background"**
- Vivid, specific moment
- Relatable to parents and anyone who's overheard this
- Shows real life, not idealized scenarios

**Past Simple - "He overslept, missed the bus, and walked to work in the rain"**
- Story sequence everyone can picture
- Uses everyday verbs: overslept, missed, walked
- Classic bad morning scenario

**Future Simple - "I'll call you after work tonight"**
- Common promise/commitment
- Natural contraction (I'll)
- Everyday timeframe (after work)

---

## Exercise & Quiz Guidelines

### Exercise Instructions
- Keep instructions brief and action-oriented
- Use "everyday" language, not "real-life work/life moments"
- Focus on what learners actually do: "Think about everyday moments"

**Example:**
> "Exercise 1: What Are They Doing?"
> Instructions: "Use am/is/are + verb-ing to show actions in progress."

### Quiz Questions
- Questions should test grammar understanding, not cultural knowledge
- Use scenarios accessible to all backgrounds
- Avoid specific cultural references (American holidays, sports teams, etc.)

---

## Vocabulary Choices

### Work References
When mentioning work, use universal terms:
- ✅ "shift", "break", "coworker", "schedule"
- ✅ "after work", "before my shift", "during break"
- ❌ "client", "meeting", "presentation", "deck"
- ❌ "remote work", "WFH", "commuting to office"

### Time References
- ✅ "yesterday", "last night", "tomorrow morning"
- ✅ "at 7 PM", "before dinner", "after the game"
- ✅ "this week", "next month", "last year"

### People & Relationships
- ✅ "my friend", "my sister", "my mom", "my neighbor"
- ✅ "everyone", "someone", "the kids"
- ❌ "the client", "the stakeholder", "the team lead"

### Places
- ✅ "home", "the store", "the park", "the bus stop"
- ✅ "the restaurant", "the factory" (when work context is needed)
- ❌ "the office", "the conference room", "the cubicle"

---

## Formatting Conventions

### Explanations
- Use `<strong>` tags to highlight the verb tense being taught
- Include checkmarks (✓) for validation: "✓ Clear past time, action is done"
- Keep explanations to one sentence when possible

**Example:**
```typescript
{
    sentence: "I <strong>woke up</strong> at 6 AM yesterday morning.",
    explanation: "✓ Clear past time, action is done",
}
```

### Tip Boxes
- Title should be concise: "💡 Quick Contrast", "💡 Key Point"
- Content should be one clear sentence contrasting two concepts
- Use examples that match the overall tone

**Example:**
```typescript
tipBox: {
    title: "💡 Quick Contrast",
    content: "Past Continuous = in-progress background. Past Simple = completed event. 'I was cooking when the fire alarm went off.'"
}
```
